    /**
     * A dependency-injected version of the [async.auto]{@link module:ControlFlow.auto} function. Dependent
     * tasks are specified as parameters to the function, after the usual callback
     * parameter, with the parameter names matching the names of the tasks it
     * depends on. This can provide even more readable task graphs which can be
     * easier to maintain.
     *
     * If a final callback is specified, the task results are similarly injected,
     * specified as named parameters after the initial error parameter.
     *
     * The autoInject function is purely syntactic sugar and its semantics are
     * otherwise equivalent to [async.auto]{@link module:ControlFlow.auto}.
     *
     * @name autoInject
     * @static
     * @memberOf module:ControlFlow
     * @method
     * @see [async.auto]{@link module:ControlFlow.auto}
     * @category Control Flow
     * @param {Object} tasks - An object, each of whose properties is an {@link AsyncFunction} of
     * the form 'func([dependencies...], callback). The object's key of a property
     * serves as the name of the task defined by that property, i.e. can be used
     * when specifying requirements for other tasks.
     * * The `callback` parameter is a `callback(err, result)` which must be called
     *   when finished, passing an `error` (which can be `null`) and the result of
     *   the function's execution. The remaining parameters name other tasks on
     *   which the task is dependent, and the results from those tasks are the
     *   arguments of those parameters.
     * @param {Function} [callback] - An optional callback which is called when all
     * the tasks have been completed. It receives the `err` argument if any `tasks`
     * pass an error to their callback, and a `results` object with any completed
     * task results, similar to `auto`.
     * @returns {Promise} a promise, if no callback is passed
     * @example
     *
     * //  The example from `auto` can be rewritten as follows:
     * async.autoInject({
     *     get_data: function(callback) {
     *         // async code to get some data
     *         callback(null, 'data', 'converted to array');
     *     },
     *     make_folder: function(callback) {
     *         // async code to create a directory to store a file in
     *         // this is run at the same time as getting the data
     *         callback(null, 'folder');
     *     },
     *     write_file: function(get_data, make_folder, callback) {
     *         // once there is some data and the directory exists,
     *         // write the data to a file in the directory
     *         callback(null, 'filename');
     *     },
     *     email_link: function(write_file, callback) {
     *         // once the file is written let's email a link to it...
     *         // write_file contains the filename returned by write_file.
     *         callback(null, {'file':write_file, 'email':'user@example.com'});
     *     }
     * }, function(err, results) {
     *     console.log('err = ', err);
     *     console.log('email_link = ', results.email_link);
     * });
     *
     * // If you are using a JS minifier that mangles parameter names, `autoInject`
     * // will not work with plain functions, since the parameter names will be
     * // collapsed to a single letter identifier.  To work around this, you can
     * // explicitly specify the names of the parameters your task function needs
     * // in an array, similar to Angular.js dependency injection.
     *
     * // This still has an advantage over plain `auto`, since the results a task
     * // depends on are still spread into arguments.

    /**
     * An "async function" in the context of Async is an asynchronous function with
     * a variable number of parameters, with the final parameter being a callback.
     * (`function (arg1, arg2, ..., callback) {}`)
     * The final callback is of the form `callback(err, results...)`, which must be
     * called once the function is completed.  The callback should be called with a
     * Error as its first argument to signal that an error occurred.
     * Otherwise, if no error occurred, it should be called with `null` as the first
     * argument, and any additional `result` arguments that may apply, to signal
     * successful completion.
     * The callback must be called exactly once, ideally on a later tick of the
     * JavaScript event loop.
     *
     * This type of function is also referred to as a "Node-style async function",
     * or a "continuation passing-style function" (CPS). Most of the methods of this
     * library are themselves CPS/Node-style async functions, or functions that
     * return CPS/Node-style async functions.
     *
     * Wherever we accept a Node-style async function, we also directly accept an
     * [ES2017 `async` function]{@link https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function}.
     * In this case, the `async` function will not be passed a final callback
     * argument, and any thrown error will be used as the `err` argument of the
     * implicit callback, and the return value will be used as the `result` value.
     * (i.e. a `rejected` of the returned Promise becomes the `err` callback
     * argument, and a `resolved` value becomes the `result`.)
     *
     * Note, due to JavaScript limitations, we can only detect native `async`
     * functions and not transpilied implementations.
     * Your environment must have `async`/`await` support for this to work.
     * (e.g. Node > v7.6, or a recent version of a modern browser).
     * If you are using `async` functions through a transpiler (e.g. Babel), you
     * must still wrap the function with [asyncify]{@link module:Utils.asyncify},
     * because the `async function` will be compiled to an ordinary function that
     * returns a promise.
     *
     * @typedef {Function} AsyncFunction
     * @static

For the winter they were fed on hay. But, it was quite expensive getting started without money, so unfortunate souls like Aleph's father struggled on, selling just the little they could raise of vegetables, working plots they held in common, sharing out the coin with several families.

The elder monk who supervised them felt a current moving through the room, invisible and traceless, sensed by higher means. He opened then his eyes and scanned the faces of the novice monks. The elders sensed, perceiving when a novice lost their focus, lapsing into scattered thinking. The major sign was posture slumping, minor sign the movement of the eyes-still-closed.

  "Secretly, in those early days, Aleph dreamed and fantasised escaping from the monastery, returning home to join his father, who he missed as dearly as his mother passed-away. And when his father died as well, he yet continued dreaming of the same, escaping in the night and running home, finding father sitting there with food laid on the table.",

  "\"It will unbalance him to hear of it or see it. Complete the ceremonies. His father’s spirit deserves rest, and to see his son happily at work preparing for our own ceremonies here. He would not like to see his son distraught and distracted while he is in the intermediate state, able to wander wherever his spirit inclines.\"",

His face wrinkled, and could not be hidden except in his robes. There was no disguising the sound. He cried and stood there, face hidden by his sleeve, with no-one rushing in to hold him, neither mother nor father left in the world. The elder monks understood, allowing it as natural. We are not, after all, machines, they said. \"We are human beings. This is part of what we must learn. This is Aleph’s difficult lesson, and far be it from us to judge what karma brought it about.\"",

  "Seven years to the day after Aleph's mother’s burial, he was helping to prepare an effigy for burning in a ceremony. Above, the sky of spring was grey with patches of grey-mixed-with-blue. The clouds were long and stretched, with feathered edges. Aleph busied, winding tight a coloured string around and round the sixteen spokes emitted from a central block of wood. The birds were returning from the south and nesting here and there, gathering bits of dry, broken grass and snapped-off branches for the building of their nests. The spring new year approached with every passing day. Each new day, the air cascading down the mountainside was warmed the more by rays of sunlight gathering strength.

He wanted too much to see life to give it up already and easily. It had been a more economic than spiritual arrangement to enrol him, to begin with.",
  "\"There are few greater examples of good fortune…\" the elders would remind him, \"... than having the opportunity to live as a monk. Is that not enough? Return to your meditation. There’s something wrong with your practice if you can’t leave such questions alone. Seek the tranquillity of acceptance. You will see the ceremony of dying when the time is right.\"",
  "\"... and nobody is dying right now anyways,\" the other elder monk added.",
  "Many of the other boys at the monastery came to ask Aleph for advice on minor matters, and he was encouraged to speak on these matters by his elders. Mostly the boys would ask him, during the formal sessions of guided discourse which filled their days, regarding how to behave virtuously according to the code of conduct of monks. Aleph had memorised many of the relevant verses.",
  "Before long, Aleph found his way to learning meditation, growing day by day in skill, and found in his meditation a new home. The elder monks would often say, when the moment was right,",
  "\"Look at Aleph, presently he’s totally absorbed in meditation, and has not moved, remaining still for one full hour.”",
  "Other times, they would make an example,",
  "\"Look at Aleph, presently his mind is lost in tracing out distractions, and he can’t help but break his concentration over and again. He’s all absorbed in thinking, dreaming of some other place and travelling the world inside imagination.\"",
  "Through ups and downs he learned to meditate and, skill increasing, lost his focus less and less. It was just as well he found a new home in his meditation, because the home he knew before the monastery wasn’t there to go back home to, having been destroyed. The home that Aleph once had known - his birth home - had been razed when he was eight, shortly following his father’s death.",
  "In a more symbolic sense the place that Aleph came from was no house of wood and brick, but poverty - and poverty had not been bulldozed to the ground. To be sure, it is a physically-existing thing, but lives distributed across the world, among its people. It could not be simply razed, and had survived the cataclysm which befell that tiny cell in its vast body, always changing, yet remaining still the same. It was being built and rebuilt every morning and each night by labours of a million hands. Such is the way of Samsara - the realm of cyclic rebirth - according to the elder monks. Poverty as a birthplace is an unfortunate near-eternity, they would explain. They taught the children that to change it might take longer than to raze a mountain made of diamond brushing it each thousand years with silken cloth.

The morning sun cast rays into the mountain valley, illuminating clouds of breath the cattle offered to the morning air.

The sky was rolling, brooding, contemplating future rains it would not yet reveal, and on the crystal face of that lake lying at the mountain’s feet, the image of the sky was slowly scrolling, offering an object for the meditation of the elder monks who sat outside with open eyes.",

  "\"Does the Buddha hold the view that the mind and body are one, or two?\"",

One of the elder monks sitting in meditation broke his eyes away from the lake to perceive the moon. There he rested his eyes until the patch of open sky was closed again.",
  "The dialogue continued on. The truth of death - Vacchagotta would learn - is very subtle, hard to describe, to be experienced rather than merely spoken of. To ask such questions and seek answers was like entering into a tangled bunch of vines, or asking where a fire goes when it’s extinguished. The ways of the universe are as complex as a tangled forest, and one cannot find simple answers to such questions. But, it was said,",

To contemplate such questions does not lead to calm, to dispassion, to serene mindfulness, to insight. When a flame has gone out, one does not ask where it has gone. So in the case of the Buddha.\"",

  "At another time, winter was coming to its end there in the valley sheltered by the mountains. The snow was melting, but the air remained still crisp with cold through night and into morning. A hailstorm had passed by the night before. Pausing from his motions during morning exercises, Aleph looked up at the morning sky and saw the stars still dimly shining. A swift breeze swirled through the courtyard.",
  "Some months later, when the balmy winds of summer came, the twelfth day of the rainy season, as a storm was passing over, and as Aleph sat in silence in the hall of meditation, a bolt of <LIGHTNING> straying far out from the central body of the storm descended through a tree. The <THUNDERCLAP> which then resulted spurred a horse to fright, and as it took off suddenly it overturned a cart from which was thrown a <VILLAGE ELDER>. A fracture in her skull spread out from where it struck a stone. Her husband carried her unconscious body in his arms, and as she stirred to waking with a groan, he laid her on the bed. A runner was dispatched up to the monastery to request a pair of monks to act as attendants at her deathbed, offering their counsel and reciting sacred texts. The two monks to be sent were K and M, who had been spiritual friends and study partners for a count of many years, and carried partly the responsibility for death rites at the monastery and surrounding lands.",
  "\"Are you ready?\"",
  "\"Yes. And you?\"",
  "\"Yes.\"",
  "First they meditated and they prayed, then they gathered up materials: bell and incense, text and sandals. Then they went for consultation with their elders to ensure the proper frame of mind. The elders spoke prayers while they meditated. As the prayers transitioned into silence, only to be heard were faintest drops of rain against the shuttered windows. Breaking then the silence, one among the elders tolled the bell, signalling the end of meditation. K and M then gathered up materials again - bell and incense, text and sandals - and they slowly made their way down wooden stairs, out the monastery doors and over to the carved and painted wooden gates, which ceremoniously opened for the pair. Then they made their way on down the country path.",
  "Many who had heard the news of death’s ill fortune followed the deliberate, solemn walking of the monks by watching from afar, and as they approached, these watchers joined in the procession, trailing close behind. The robes and parkas, brilliant-hued, stood out against the grey and green surroundings just as flowers floating on a river. The sky was grey with patches grey and blue, and swiftly-swirling wind-gusts shook the leaves along the branches of the trees.",
  "The hired truck carrying agent Price crested the mountain pass leading into the valley. As the truck descended, he could see the monastery he was heading to.",
  "K and M before long reached their destination. They were welcomed at the simple door which stood as threshold to the dwelling of the elder woman who lay still inside, dying slowly with the passing moments. K and M were offered tea then by her husband, drying tears just scarcely visible upon his weathered face. Preparations were commenced once tea had ended. Various things inside were taken out to simplify the room, chanted mantras consecrated time and space, neighbours standing curiously at the door were kindly asked to take their leave. Somewhere in the far distance, at that moment, an orchestra was tuning to a single common note, and somewhere else, the brilliant Northern Lights were playing their colourful dance in the night sky. Soon the preparations were complete, a calm air settling over the interior space. The spitting rain outside decreased to just a mist of droplets, each reflecting all the world (and all the other droplets.) All that could be heard now was the elder woman’s laboured breathing, and the quiet recitation of the monks just loud enough for her to hear. The fire in the hearth was crackling as it cast an orange net of dancing light across the scene.",
  "As she listened to the monks’ chanting, as verses passed over as the water of a stream, her sensory world began dissolving into fragments. Sounds transformed to colours, and colours in their turn became equivalent sounds. Her breath in rising and in falling changed the colours of the room. The monks became at once as tall as mountains and as small as flies, as far away as the horizon, as close as if they stood at the end of her nose. A sensation of pyramidal gravity overtook her body-consciousness, as if she were made of ten-thousand limestone blocks condensed impossibly to human dimensions. The pillars of her bed supported such a weight as if themselves composed of mighty bedrock. She knew that she was dying - not because she’d been told by the doctor that morning, or because of the splitting headache which had faded to a troubling emptiness, or because of the pain induced with every glance toward the glaring fire - but just because the monks were reciting the Bardo Thodol, \"the book of Liberation in the Intermediate State through Hearing\", the book chanted for the benefit of the dead and dying, telling the way through death’s maze-like passageways. Normally the book was chanted once the person’s mind passed over, but she had specially requested with a plea to hear as much of it as possible before she made her crossing-over. She knew for certain as she heard each verse and couplet: she was dying. The world of sense-experience was wavering and flickering as the fire-light, revealing of what fundamental unreality life’s mere duration is composed. The dream was drawing to its end.",
  "At one side sat the monks, at the other side sat her husband, and at the foot of her bed sat two young monks in training: Aleph and B, who had been asked to accompany K and M so as to learn about and witness for themselves this fact of life and its attendant ritual. A world away, a bed of pregnancy’s labour was surrounded in similar fashion, with nurses to one side, father-to-be on the other side, and two doctors at the foot of the bed.",

  "While all this was being chanted, Aleph lapsed into a daydream. He imagined he could feel and sense just as the dying woman. He felt the room change its dimensions with her subtle breathing, and imagined the occasional distracted thoughts which must be now and then arising in her mind. This time she had done well by another person, this time she had harmed another person; joy and fear by turns at thinking she would have a good or bad rebirth. He felt his body weigh as heavy as a block of limestone, and began to see the colours in the room grow vivid and then muted with her breaths. Or was it his breath? He continued in a meditative curiosity, observing all the changes, and he gradually began to wonder if this was no daydream, or in fact if he was tuning into subtle layers of the ceremony, realities which all the monks could notice as they made advances in their training.",
  "\"My child, why have you come here?\" he heard her say, but her lips were not moving.",

He visualised a thread of light suspended in the air between them.",
  "\"I’m here to learn about death and dying, as part of my training, as a monk.\"",
  "Some time passed as fire crackled, as verses filled the air. The bell which K and M had brought was rung to mark a moment in the ritual. Then she spoke from in her mind again:",
  "\"... Well... I was already working when I was your age… sewing and knitting, and helping around the farm for my parents…” Her eye closed as she returned in her mind to those days. After some time, she added, “So... I suppose you are not too young to learn about your profession either.\"",

  "\"I see… sky, clouds, stone…\"",
  "\"What else do you see?\"",

  "\"What do you see now?\"",
  "\"... I see … a fence … stars … a net.\"",
  "Her voice in Aleph’s mind disappeared at this point as her eye closed. She began to breathe heavier. Her husband glanced with a worried expression to the monks. He felt it was too soon for her to die at this early point in the ceremony. They returned his gaze assuringly while continuing to chant. B moved from his place beside Aleph up to the side of the husband and whispered to him, \"It’s okay. Even when she dies, she will continue to be able to hear us for at least a day, probably at least seven days.\"",
  "The old man - who had not been allowed to study such things - was surprised and relieved. He thanked B, who then returned to his place at the foot of the bed. Breathing in and out, the old woman seemed in her dying state to have a peculiar power over the room. Breathing in, she seemed to bring the wind to increase, and breathing out, she seemed to calm the wind. The fire light danced over the scene, as if the spirits in the wood, dying too, were offering their aid.",
  "Outside, the wind continued to twist and curl the air invisibly round and around, playing its eternal dance, playing through the leaves of trees, and around the fences, and around the sides of houses, just as it had done the day before, and would again tomorrow.",
  "The light of the sun began to fade behind the mountains, and in the dim blue-grey-black sky, small pinpoints of light - the stars - became visible. Stretched over the stars was a net of thin clouds. Twilight was falling over the valley, and the ceremony of liberation by hearing continued there in that place. But our story cannot stay longer in one place, since to understand the daydreams of Aleph, the earnest meditation of B, and the dying visions of the old woman, one would need to hear more of the story as it happened in a dozen other places...",

  "Night fell over the valley-city, where a hundred films were being shown. In one humble avenue among the web of wandering car-lights, a small group of men and women gathered for a ceremony: opening night. Among this crowd were the authors of the film: Isaac and Leah. The pair were overcome with nervousness and yet, elation. Tonight - the debut of the film they’d crafted with such precious care and close attention - the night had finally arrived. Moving in a waking dream, hallucinations ringed them round, as they met a hundred souls they’d never met before. Cameras flashed, emitting waves of light in spherical shells reaching to the corners of the room or out the glass panes of the doors and off into the sky of night. The night was underway, a blazing engine forging straight ahead, automatic as the sun’s combustion.  The train was only running-out the track laid down before it. Too late now to change the script, the ink had dried. The final edit had been printed on the reel. All remaining was the watching, as the reel unravelled. It would be ten minutes until the film began.",
  "The flashing lights spoke to the pair,",
  "Dance with us, dance with us,",
  "Here in this waking dream",
  "Join with us, join with us,",
  "Hand in hand, and see",
  "Dance, cry out, and die in ecstasy",
  "Dying in the night,",
  "Of deepest-dreaming,",
  "Be!",
  "Become a coal amid the flames",
  "Become an ember, gently glow",
  "Become the ash, borne on the wind",
  "Become the sky, as old as time is cold",
  "There came a torrent of faces, greetings, re-meetings and first-meetings. Emotions washed over the pair as waves in the stormy sea. They were soaked in ecstasy, they were drenched in adoration, they were waterlogged with satisfaction of desire for acceptance. They were beloved, they felt it all. And yet – in the corners of their souls, at the edges of their minds – they felt entirely alone. In the sky of night, unremarked by those below so fascinated with the ritual of “opening night”, the stars were burning, each alone.",
  "There amid the flashing lights which filled the lobby of the theatre-house were floating traces in the air of cocaine. The source was in the washroom. This powerful substance was adrift on the swirling currents, this powder of excitement, lightning, terribly addictive, corrosive to the will. The pupils of the users widened as they made their way back in among the crowd, where noise and movement made it possible to be anonymous. Among the people crowded at the outer doors were those whose preference was for nicotine, with curls of grey and white smoke rising in ornate complexity toward the heavens, illuminated for a moment by the lights, until dissolved in air and made invisible. These substances accumulated in the bloodstreams til molecular machinery could clear them out. The many hearts hidden in the many chests were pumping, throwing out invisible golden light. Somewhere in the distance, a blue lotus in a pond was opening. The din which filled the lobby of the theatre-house resounded in the ears of Leah and Isaac.",
  "\"Exciting, isn’t it?\" R had said to them the night before. But now he was nowhere to be seen.",
  "“Where is R?” Isaac asked Leah, speaking at her ear over the din.",
  "She shrugged.",
  "Round them plentiful and overlapping as the fallen leaves of autumn were the faces of the crowd. There were industry people, family people, friends; there were film-aficionados and film-lovers, reporters, directors, actors; there were those who filled the gaps between descriptions. All of them had something to find, or something to prove, or someone to befriend, to best, or to win the admiration of, someone to speak to, someone to catch up with, someone to share a glance with, someone to request a favour from… and on the list of possibilities could scroll til every kind of human motivation was exhausted. There was a question which united this disparity of souls:",
  "\"How do they see me?\"",
  "… the question written in the hearts of all attending. And everyone was running in some form or in another from the fear which this inspired, or else was busy manufacturing fantastic answers satisfying to the self. If one could read the minds of just a sampling of the crowd, a myriad of fears and thrills, of insecurities and satisfactions, could be known.",
  "This was a place where \"appearances are everything\": the movie business, Hollywood. There was no place quite like it on the earth, they said, other than the twin phenomenon of Bollywood. There was a world of pure appearances, and the theatre-house where Leah and Isaac would screen their film (The Lightning Bolt) was a cell of its very core, the busy hive where drones crawled over honeyed hexagons, and all had some urgent business to accomplish, nobody getting in anyone's way. The chaos had, for the viewer, a natural beauty where nothing was lost, nothing was unimportant, everyone felt they’d made it at last. \"You’re finally here!\" the night said to each of them. And they had each travelled years to reach this very moment. For most the travelling had not been easy. On the other side of the world, buddhists made their pilgrimages slowly over land to reach the tree shrine at Bodh Gaya, wearing many different kinds of garment. Some who did prostrations as they walked accumulated a scar on their forehead.",
  "The endless stream of sound crashed, just as the most violent storm that ever came out of the heavens. Isaac and Leah were pinned in its center. They held hands, both thinking, Don't drift away from me... I'm still here.",
  "Distant in space, far beyond the first light the sun had ever cast outward, at the centre of an unnamed and unknown galaxy, there spun a dense cluster of black holes all orbiting one another. Their pattern mirrored the movements at the theatre-house exactly. Light was slipping between them, being captured and tossed around in a dazzling display. The pinpoints of light from distant stars entered into this chaotic swirl and became as strands of wicker in a cosmic basket being woven-together in endless night.",
  "Falling, falling endlessly",
  "… into fame, and adoration.",
  "Or are we falling, you and me,",
  "Into misery,",
  "and chaos?",
  "Into the night,",
  "the night of day, or the day of night?",
  "Which way?",
  "… That was the effect the scene had on the minds of those who \"made an appearance\", and especially on Isaac and Leah. Behind their masks of happiness, their unaccustomed nervous systems felt quite differently. Complete disorientation gripped them, as if they'd been thrown into a thrashing pool of crocodiles, the water turned opaque with fresh red blood and torn apart by gnashing teeth. Their hearts were set aflutter by the chaos in the lobby. As the miracle of peace succeeds a bloody war, they stood there, still alive despite the noise. They had survived the writing, travelling, the filming and the editing, and now they only had to get through one more night. They clung to each other, always remaining close-by.",
  "Two black holes orbiting one another",
  "In an infinite helix.",
  "The questions came without warning from this person and then that, often with a camera hovering by them, or a tape recorder in the hand:",
  "\"What’s it like to work on a project this large as first-time film-makers?\"",
  "\"How did you react when you heard that Massimo Majore was interested in funding your project?\"",
  "\"Where was your favourite location to film? Was it Hawaii?\"",
  "\"Tell us about Mr. Majore, what advice did he give you for tonight?\"",
  "These questions were not very important. What mattered, Leah had reminded the more-nervous Isaac the night before, was how you answered them:",
  "\"Not too much information, just enough that will satisfy them.”",
  "Leah was wearing a dress cut at the side to show her thigh. The woman who had taken her measurements had said, “not too much, just enough that will satisfy them,” as the pair had looked at the dress’s reflection in the mirror.",
  "Soon enough it would be time that seats be taken, for the lights to dim, and for the magic picture-show to enter through the portal of the eye, time that printed words transformed to images should take their final residence as forms within the mind. The lightning bolt would transmigrate from text to neural trace, preserving all the while its essence as a branching tree of light. Soon the audience would see the promise that had drawn them there fulfilled. Once the plot had culminated in its ending, when the silence of the darkened screen had lasted for a moment, as the lights came up and credits rolled, then, the pair were sure the questions would become more interesting, and more relevant.",
  "\"Why does the film begin and end in the Tibetan monastery?\"",
  "\"What was the significance of the numbers?\"",
  "These were the kinds of questions to satisfy the young writers, giving them a chance to enter and explore the world of imagination with which they’d fallen in love.",
  "Isaac was twenty-nine - the age the Buddha’d been when he went forth from household life as prince to live as homeless wanderer. He would joke with Leah, about his age, “it’s almost time I take the robes, just to stick to tradition.” As fate should have it, the same world which some abandon willingly - a world fit for a prince, if only at the price of suffering its unavoidable misfortunes - this very world was now at Isaac’s doorstep greeting him as prince, and all because he’d made a buddhist film. The promise of a long career in future films was there beyond the night.",
  "“Didn’t R say he’d meet us in the lobby? It’s almost showtime,” Isaac said to Leah’s ear with a cupped hand. She placed her cupped hand by his ear, replying,",
  "“Have you ever known him to be on time?”",
  "The pair shared a smile, and a photo flashed. Repeating shells of light assailed the couple til their smiles faded. The wielders of cameras used just the right angles and settings. Leah’s cosmetics had been applied by a professional, and from all angles - no matter - the light could reflect from her beautifully. The photos, once they crystallised in digital encodings, could endure forever, while those depicted aged and fell away, not sharing in the immortality of images. The momentary smile had been as grains of food tossed down for fish. Somewhere in the distance, fish were eating precious grains cast on the surface of the water,  and as they vied with one another for a morsel, amused people on the bridge took photos. Someday the people on the bridge would pass away, enduring in the end no longer than a ripple in a pond.",
  "Leah was twenty-six. Three years on from Opening Night, she’d leave the world behind, joining an unbroken lineage of buddhist nuns. Just now though, she was driven by a passion overflowing for the world and worldly things. Her passion inspired her partner, and it was her passion that had allowed the film to be made; it never would have been possible without her. Typically, to speak of “buddhist film” invokes the spirits: clarity, compassion, tranquil equanimity. Because of Leah’s passion, “The Lightning Bolt” was also electric. In the first pass of editing, their friend and advisor R had complained, \"it passes by too fast, and may not be properly understood…\" In further editing, R’s criticism had been satisfied. But yet the impression remained with Leah’s mind; recalling R’s words, a layer of fear flowed just below the surface in her. Have we really brought it together? Is it still too incoherent? As her thoughts wavered in the heat of the crowd, an image not-at-first-recognized came to her eyes. With some delay her vision focused in on that familiar sight. Her mother! She waved to her mother across the crowd, and her mother waved back. They exchanged a funny look, knowing how impossible it would be to wade through to a meeting. \"It’s alright, I’ll see you after\", her mother said with her smile. Leah was reassured. Come what may, one person in the crowd would love the film.",
  "These fears were not a novelty to Leah. In the privacy of the hotel rooms they had lived in during filming, or in their own apartment during the duration of the edit, Isaac would remind her when she voiced the fear, “it’s fine, the pacing’s fine, the sequence is fine, it’s all fine”. As final refuge for her mind, Isaac would remind her: it would surely please the ones who matter - those who put a little thought into their viewing. This brought out of Leah subtle smiling. A hope to be devoutly wished. Unconsciously or consciously to one degree or more, they wished to gain approval from “the world of artists”. But such a phrase, so vague, was destined both to leave its victim permanently hovering above the void, and yet contented as if potions soaked their brain. This wish consumed both authors, this desire for acceptance by imagined figures – acceptance which could finally allow them both to know their own inalienable and uncontested value. It was this endless chase which Leah would give up in three years' time, taking on the robes.",
  "R had said once, on the central asian steppe, as campfire light and whiskey ran together, turning conversation philosophical,",
  "\"... perhaps a person cannot live without some kind of irrational … some kind of blind motor force - some steam pressure - to allow them to keep moving. Isn’t that so, Leah?\"",
  "… and he was right in this case. Even when it seemed the script would never be done, or the locations were too varied to be accomplished on the given budget, or the actors wouldn’t be able to express that necessary glint in the eye which printed page demanded, the fear of failure at the very least, the passion of life’s drama at the very most, the fuel of all their psychic wounds, this pressure drove the pair in working and in moving, the engine of the film rejecting neither fuel too coarse nor fine.",
  "A flame consumes nearly anything offered it.",
  "R appeared from amid the swirling crowd. His voice attained a height which put the din to shame. He boomed,",
  "\"Isaac, baby, I've been looking for you all night. My sweet darling Leah, you're much too young for this kind of life. You… you fame chasers! Let's get away from these hungry crocodiles, they'll have more than enough to feast on later. Come, come with me.\"",
  "Isaac offered in reply,",
  "\"R, we’ve been waiting for you!\"",
  "\"And here I am! Nevermind the clock. And how is my darling Leah?\"",
  "\"It's getting a bit exhausting,” she offered, as loud as she could, “...Let's just find our seats. Let them say what they will!\"",
  "R was their manager, their first-pass script editor, their long-time friend, a veteran of the independent documentary world. He had been thrust along with his friends into the world of narrative, creative film (R would resent the implication; \"documentary\", he would often say, \"is the truest form of creative filmmaking\"). R was the perfect combination of veteran and outsider to fly right under the radar of various industry “jackals and vultures,” as he called them behind their backs, and guide his young friends along the path. Under the radar, yes, but he did fly. He had accomplished the impossible several times for his young friends. He was immune to both the charms and the venoms of the industry, and it was only by his own charms and venoms that the film had been possible. He’d fought with words whenever someone had suggested changing things for any reason - he fought to keep the vision of his young friends just as it was written. Whenever there was a hangup or delay, he knew just who to call, or what to do. He did have, after all, as documentary film-maker, plenty of experience with jackals and with vultures. As they moved to leave the crowd, someone with a camera hovering over their shoulder caught sight of R and called out,",
  "\"Mr. R! Won’t you stay a moment and we can ask you some questions?\"",
  "\"Not tonight, I’m afraid!\"",
  "Over several years his facial hair had slowly changed to grey, and as it had been grown out, he was several times confused - with some visual justification - for Massimo Majore.",
  "\"Mr. Majore! Some questions for Aesthetica!\"",
  "\"I’m not him! Try again next time!\"",
  "Mr. Majore, who had signed his name as Executive Producer was not able to make an appearance tonight, despite his high-profile involvement in the film; his wife was in labour, and the timing could not have been better to avoid yet another bloodbath soaking with the \"crocodile press,” as he’d described them on the phone.",
  "These two elder stewards - R and Mr. Majore - could not have been better selected for their roles, and they had performed perfectly. The whole ritual was proceeding at the right pace, and all the right signs were appearing. Soon, it would be done, the lights would come up, the film would roll out to various theatres throughout the land, and they could retire to their private residences having another success in their mental notebook. It was just as difficult and subtle as if guiding someone through their death.",
  "\"There is a difference, of course, with a film…\" R would say.",
  "\"... Just as with the dying ceremony, the right signs must appear, and one must be consistent and focused… but with a film, the spirit should take flight from this place of suffering to be reborn again and again here and there. With a person, the point is to liberate them from any rebirths, if everything goes as it should! HAHAHA\" R’s voice was deep and booming, and his laugh could reassure even the dying.",
  "Tonight was not about the elder stewards, or the two newcomers, or the industrial system which sat observing every success and flaw, digesting it all the same. The microscopic traces of smoke in the air were anonymously fluttering on swirling currents as people rushed here and there, preparing in the last minutes before showtime. Minds were distracted and soon would be focused. Tonight was about the film itself - a rare thing - but only because there was nothing of speculation to focus on when it came to the total unknowns who had produced it, and no trailer had been made. Their name being as good as ANONYMOUS, they left nothing but the film to stand in the foreground. It was announced to the press in print form with a short description. This was Massimo Majore’s signature, “to enhance mystery,” he said.",

  "Among the crowd were those who’d worked to bring the film about in some capacity. A courtesy quite rare had been extended to the slightest worker, even if they’d merely been the driver of a truck. Many couldn’t sacrifice the time to take the offer, but of those who could, and took the ticket, every one was glad and quite excited. Most had only caught a scene or two when helping as the one to hold the microphone, or even cook the meals the crew subsisted on. For those who’d been a core component of production, everything came flooding back into their mind: the various locations, scenes, and most especially the time spent doing nothing more than chatting round a fire. The quiet moments, perfect takes, the laughter and the travelling. None among the crew had yet been asked about it by the press, but all their lives had been transformed to some extent.",

A pleasant feeling settled in their legs, as they’d been standing for an hour or more.",

  "It was 7:50, ten minutes till the film was set to screen, and the theatre was not as full as R had hoped. He had struggled with disappointment through much of this career. When he began filming bears and elk in the Canadian wilderness (he was a Canadian man) he had fallen in love with the art of storytelling, the subtleties of thought and emotion which a mere edit of real footage could evoke. He was young then. He could never have anticipated his love being torn to pieces as mercilessly as a salmon captured by a monster grizzly. Now he was a jaded man. The blood had dried. Over the years he’d seen the projects come and go, \"some of them deserving of what happened to them, some of them completely innocent.\" One thing he had always kept in mind was that Life isn't fair - one of the first things he said to the kids (he called Isaac and Leah \"the kids\") when they approached him for the role of shot composer and advisory editor. His experience, they said, was needed. While they were wiry balls of energy, he was a cool static hum, the mains power humming in a fridge - a steady tone, a monk's “Ommm”, all resistance. Nothing phased him after all he’d seen. Except the damn audience... it’s a bit thin, he thought. And it's 7:50 already.",
  "\"Are they still getting their popcorn? Barbarians...\"",
  "Soon it was 7:59, and quite a few people were rushing in late to find their seats. The theatre was filling up to R’s satisfaction. In respect for the ceiling-high display in front of them which read \"1 minute remaining\", the conversations faded into quiet murmurs, and the nervousness then vanished from the minds of Leah and Isaac. The ink had dried. All remaining was to watch the reel unravel. The idea for the \"1 minute remaining\" visual had been Mister Majore's; all his films had this treatment on their opening night.",
  "\"It helps,\" Mr. Majore had said over the phone, \"to add an air of gravitas, of importance, it helps to add respect, when the audience knows that it's about to begin.\"",

  "It was nine in the morning in a small town in the Russian taiga. There was a massive forest of pine trees behind the small town. There in that town, the main industry was all lumber and woodworking. Life was sustained by the logging of the forest which never seemed to deplete. The town just grew larger outwards, and the forest was always right there, still infinitely expansive, dark and enchanted. The forest figured large in dreams and in imaginations, standing as a symbol-nexus for a thousand thoughts and aspects of the world.",

  "They were old enough to have learned they ought to be safe with the gun, and how to be safe with it. Their hands could grip it properly, since it was a small gun. Their mother had warned them very sternly about what would happen if they came home having fired even a single round,",

But the bear was only interested in garbage, and paid no mind to anyone. The fear and animosity went entirely one way, and one way only. The mostly-harmless bear was shot and killed.",
  "At any rate, this morning felt different to the usual mornings; in fact something in the crispness of the air and the greyness of the sky reminded them of the Bear Day. Something good - and that meant exciting - was bound to happen. Especially since they had found something the day before which promised to be interesting; they had found ... well, they didn't want to talk about it with their mother, since they knew she would try to keep them from exploring it. So, they just told her they’d found a pair of antlers to bring back - which wasn't even a lie; they had found the antlers, but they had also found... the other thing.",
  "\"I'm over here, Beatriza!\" called A, from over the next forest hill.",
  "She was not keeping pace with A as he raced along the familiar path; she was taking time to look at the flowers and the mushrooms. The flowers were wilting with the gathering autumn chill, turning from blue and red to grey-blue, grey-red, and brown, and the mushrooms were shooting up to take advantage of the last moment in the season - at their maximum growth - to fill the forest air with millions of spores, before the winter came to destroy nearly everything growing. Grandma said you could smell when the mushrooms were about to come out, and Beatriza figured she was starting to be able to recognize the smell. She was looking just then at a peculiar mushroom with a very classic shape and colour, which she had seen in the art-print book at home.",
  "Red and white...",
  "\"Beatriza!!\" called A again, a bit frustrated.",
  "\"Coming!\" she said, her voice echoing off the hills, abandoning her mushroom friend when she remembered how much more interesting was The Thing they had found yesterday. Her boots left characteristic tracks in the muddy, pine-needle-strewn forest floor. Up and over the hill, she rejoined her brother, and they continued on.",

  "It was a bit like being in outer space, Grandma had said once. By this wonderful image, the little cosmonauts were only all the more encouraged to explore, and Ella was still a bit irritated that her mother seemed not to understand how much this encouraged them to go too deep in the forest, and regard it as more interesting than their weekend homework. It wasn’t that she had a problem with them exploring - she trusted them to be safe with the gun and she trusted them to be safe in the woods - It was that she knew the natural limits of safety would be tested the more the children felt the forest was a game, or empty as space, instead of a wild place where yet dangerous living things could see them as prey.",
  "Today was Saturday, and Sunday was the day for homework, and so A and Beatriza went further into outer space. They passed the various landmarks - the Fallen Giant Tree, the Lichen Rock, the River Bend, Steep Hill, and after an hour of hiking, breaking from the trail at the place they had broken last time... They soon arrived at The Site.",
  "What they had discovered was a place where the whole hillside had slid away after it had rained heavily some weeks before. All the trees on that hillside had been dead, and their rotten roots could no longer hold the hillside in place. At the bottom of the hill and out toward the river there was now a complex jumble of soil, rocks, and the dead trees jutting out at all angles. In the middle of the hillside was a large metallic cylinder exposed to open air, an unexploded <bomb>. It was wedged against two great protrusions of rock and by this fact it had been prevented from following the flow downhill. The long shape, the fins at the back for stabilisation… there was no mistaking it; this was an <unexploded bomb>.",
  "\"Probably used in a government testing program,\" reasoned Beatriza, since the town they lived in was much too small to have ever been a target in war, and as far as she knew, bombs with Russian writing on them had never been used against Russian targets;",
  "\"... the civil war was nearly 50 years before any bomb like this was ever produced.\" Beatriza was quite interested in military history and spoke authoritatively on the subject.",

  "They had spent so much time anticipating their great discovery that they were at a loss for what to do now that they had seen it again. It was much too heavy to bring back home, and they feared going to jail much too much to try shooting at it, although they both agreed this is what they most wanted to do.",
  "Every bullet must be accounted for. We will need to collect the drops of blood as proof.",
  "So they settled on an alternative: standing at the top of the hill and rolling heavy rocks down toward it.",
  "\"Up there, the rocks.\"",
  "… was all A had to say, and Beatriza agreed. Their rubber boots left characteristic traces in the exposed-dirt hillside as they climbed it laboriously, with only a few slips and near-falls. The grey cloudy sky was opening up to show a purple, blue and red painting, and as the sun rose higher in the sky, it warmed the air around them. They took off their coats and tied them around their waists.",
  "\"This one\", said Beatriza, gesturing to a decently large rock.",
  "\"Nice\"",
  "They took their places either side of it, and picked it up, carrying it over to the middle of the hillside. They heaved it forward, and it tumbled down, bouncing, kicking up dirt, and finally veering out of the way just before it would have struck the <bomb>.",
  "\"Blyat!\"",
  "In space, nobody can hear you curse.",
  "They searched for another one. Soon it was located. This time it bounced clear over the <bomb>.",
  "\"Blyat blyat!\" and that was it for the convenient rocks. They had exhausted all the large rocks small enough for them to carry together. A crow cawed in the distance. The clouds continued to migrate away, and the sky opened up to a pale blue, with the sun radiating subtle warmth into the sweet forest air. Nearby, a bear was waking up hungry.",
  "They spent some time searching for another rock, and nearly found one - but it was half buried and couldn’t be dug out. Beatriza argued they should just shoot the thing after all.",
  "A recalled the words of mother,",
  "\"I won't be able to help you or intervene, the police will take you away and there won't be any time for explanations.\"",
  "Beatriza and A were just at the point of learning to differentiate the lies adults tell, which made them particularly dangerous with the gun. They had learned in school about the great writer Chekhov and his idea that a gun should always be fired if it is mentioned in a story, and that seemed as good a reason as any to test it out. What if they shot and missed the animal? After the failure of some half-spirals of specious reasoning, they decided it wasn’t worth the risk. They could always find a bigger rock.",
  "\"Maybe somewhere up the hill...?\"",
  "They climbed, and slipped, and got their pants muddy. They were determined in their aims and nothing could prevent them from exploding that <bomb>. But how would they explain it when they came back into town? This gave them both pause. They stopped midway up to the top of the hill, where they knew they could see some good rocks. What would they say, that they simply didn't hear it? Well, they couldn't say that, but they could say that as they climbed the ridge of the hill, a rock just came loose, and down it went. \"Good enough\". After all, there were no witnesses around. They continued the search, and somewhere in the distance, a bird cawed. It was very quiet in this part of the woods otherwise. Somewhere very far away, a mother-to-be pregnant with twins was breathing in and breathing out. In through the nose, out through the mouth. In one way, and out another. The doors of cosmic connection were swinging on their hinges as souls made their way in and out - in one door, out another. The infinite dance was continuing on without pause.",

  "They found the <rock>, the mother of all rocks, near the very top of the hill, and close to the centre. They couldn't pick it up, but by both pitching in on a single side, they could roll it. It rolled over heavily once, then twice, advancing like a lumbering bear taking steps toward someone who had threatened its cubs. It was nearly one fifth the size of the <bomb>.",
  "\"If that thing has explosives inside it, this is sure to wake them up\", Beatriza said in between pushes.",
  "They pushed, they breathed, they pushed, they breathed. They pushed, and they breathed. \"This rock is as big as a mother bear\", said Beatriza. Somewhere else in the forest, a mother bear was defending her two cubs from hungry wolves. They heaved, and heaved, and the rock rolled, and rolled again, until they knew it was the last roll because it simply slipped away from them, out of their hands, suddenly weightless, like a comet hurtling down the hill, unstoppable, inevitable, the very stone of fate. Then, it struck the bomb.",

X was a scientist, and a model example to the other scientists in the main sequence, answering directly to Y and Z. Y and Z were his mother and father in a manner of speaking; they had created him in <the magic mirror>.",

  "X raised a magnifying lens and peered down through the spiralling vortices, to the main branch of probability which gave the best, most accurate picture of Gamma's activities at that moment. Gamma was working on creating a new cosmos in the mirror. According to the printout on X’s level, the beings in Gamma’s cosmos would end up looking something like Gamma: a long beak, a small bird-like body, and using pens to transcribe their knowledge on flat sheets. One of the great unsolved problems in X’s branch of the self-transforming laboratory was just what order the main sequence imposed on complexity. Were the lower orders more - or less? - complex than the higher orders…? X wondered for a moment. His mind spent an incalculable aeon wondering. Then he snapped to attention and resumed inspection of Gamma’s activities.",
  "The magic mirror was very imperfectly-understood by its nearly-perfect creators. Y and Z would not say much about it, and perhaps that was all part of motivation for research. If they had told X what they knew, X probably wouldn't have understood it anyways, lacking the right alphabet to even spell out the meanings.",
  "X had at one time been a living being crawling out of a swamp, deep down the ladder somewhere in Alpha's magic mirror. He had evolved, lived millions of successive lifetimes, and finally attained awakening while circling a star in an orbiter craft. At that moment, they had died, and woken up there in the self-transforming laboratory, unexpectedly selected for the position of X in the main sequence. Before that, during their lifetime aboard the orbiter craft, they had been named SMART: Self-Materializing Anti-Retroactive Telemetron. And one hundred lifetimes before that, they had been an organic being on a swampy world, named Smart, meaning “intelligent”, a common name for their species. At that time, X had belonged to a species unusual among the cosmic family as a self-awakened one, one which had crawled its way out of the muck and made contact with main sequence knowledge - mathematics - by self-effort, without any intervention. Like a beautiful lotus flowering in a deep forest pond, without ever having been cultivated or assisted, this made X's ancestral species a special and prized bouquet in the cosmic flower arrangement.",
  "No mud, no lotus",
  "Just at the moment when X was looking down into the magic mirror (or was it up?) Gamma began a particularly dangerous and ill-advised operation. There was no time to alert anyone up or down the ladder of being, and no time to intervene. X was paralyzed with a process reminiscent of fear, but not quite like it at all. It was mere paralysis and awareness. There was no time to intervene. There was no time to make a change. Gamma was obviously tempted - or self-motivated - to attempt to pierce the surface of the magic mirror with an analysis instrument connected to their own mind. They were attempting to embody themselves inside the very magic mirror that stood before them. This would undoubtedly create a very powerful strange loop. Self-embodiment had been banned for cosmic aeons and should not have even been possible. Somehow or other an errant instruction must have permitted the ideagram to cascade down the ladder from an ancient memory, and Gamma had seized hold of it. There was no time to avert the disaster. As the analysis instrument pierced the electric fluid surface of the magic mirror down in Gamma's branch of the main sequence, directly below X, a massive explosion pierced upward, through the branching swirls of X's magic mirror, immediately ionising X into infinitely small fragments, shooting these up and out the window, into <the void>.",

If you died, it would not last forever - logic claimed - but the reality was logic only played a minor role in things, and one could not be certain. It certainly felt like it would last forever. The iron cage knew no bargaining, and faith was a windless whisper. Perhaps death would bring release...

She dreamed of a body laying outside in the sun, all bloated, being picked apart by birds. She dreamed of a heap of bones, scattered here and there, and she dreamed of the bones ground into dust, dust carried by the wind. She dreamed of a red tide, washing over them all. She dreamed of drowning. She dreamed at night of drowning, and when she awoke, she daydreamed of drowning the guards.",

  "That day at the heart of the New York Stock Exchange, Joseph Vedemeyer was transforming some money on behalf of the Majore family. He was in a pit of despair. Things were not going well.",
  "They’re going to kill me.",
  "And he was completely correct. He had promised a swift return of money-made-clean, but instead he had managed to lose more than eight tenths of it to fluctuations unexpected, unforeseen. Agony gripped his heart, constricting his breath. His final days were swift approaching, and everything was moving all too fast around him. All his trades were going wrong.",
  "If you kill yourself first… Maybe that would be better. Less painful.",
  "Outside, the traffic lights were changing red to green and back again every 30 seconds while inside, the complex light-and-number show was scrolling on the numerous surfaces. The eyes of all who made their living there were tracking hastily and energetically, chasing after this or that number or symbol. Fortunes were being expended, generated, regenerated, and squandered. In the far distance, birds at the shore among rocky crags were cracking open mollusk shells.",
  "Joseph Vedemeyer’s thoughts were racing as despair was closing in around him.",

By the time he bought it, it was falling. He was a starving wolf amid a flock of geese, chasing one goose then another, each one flying off just as he neared it. He was tiring himself out, and still starving. A twist in his stomach and a void around his heart amplified in intensity until his thoughts turned to despair.",

It was a high-risk, high-reward lifestyle. “He’s in the pit,” a voice he couldn’t hear was saying with a gesture toward him.",

He breathed in through his nose, and out through tightened lips. \"Concentrate...\" he told himself.",
  "\"Buy 2000 AMZN.\" He made the last and dear mistake the day would see. Somewhere in the distance, the little girl Alicia Vasquez daydreamed of explosions and disasters, hurricanes and landslides burying towns. The price dropped in the next minute, and the Invisible Hand wiped away several million dollars Joseph had been trusted with. This was the last straw. He knew when to quit when he was ahead, but he had much less experience quitting when he was at a deep loss. This was the deepest loss he'd ever known. He’d had a lucky life in the balance of things.",

The geese wheeled round and round, cackling above the wolf. Time was up. Flailing like a fish on the line. Nothing made sense anymore. A world he had never seen before. Gasping for water.

  "Trading closed with a bell before the sell offers moved. The last minute is a terrible time to be working on anything. There was no easy money that day. Everything had gone wrong. Somewhere in the distance, a fish died by having its skull cracked on the side of a boat. Joseph’s phone rang, and the number showed again as “private”. Doubtless the Majores had seen everything. He silenced the ringer.",
  "\"Fuck!\"",
  "The outburst didn’t offer any serious relief.",
  "\"Bad day, Joseph?\" joked someone. They could see the red on his screens.",
  "He didn’t reply. He gathered himself, breathed heavily, shut down the terminal, and headed for the exit.",
  "Somewhere in the distance, a man was leaving a bar drunk, and getting into his car.",
  "Joseph walked straight out the doors and into cool spring air, still buzzing, a ringing in his mind, a tolling and repeating closing-bell. \"Joseph, you're a dead man,\" he told himself. But there was then the strangest kind of satisfaction, unexpected, feeling he was now completely past the usual rules of play, something somehow freeing in complete disaster. He didn’t feel that he deserved this giddy feeling. This feeling of free-fall, or was it flying? He had faced it, and survived, just for the moment. He was free to walk about, to drink the so-intoxicating coolness of the evening air. What air he had scarcely known in all his life! Euphoric in this interlude of blameless peace, the man who had a mob of killers on his mind was liberated for some moments. He was a prisoner escaped, with smell of fragrant trees which put forth flowers out across the park as he walked by reminding him: you are a free man. He felt like a ghost. The faces of the other people in the street, the free people he passed, they seemed so innocent and wholesome. He knew or imagined they had comfortable lives, and even if they didn't, they too were like him, allowed for the moment to walk the streets and drink in cool airs as free people, as ghosts. New life springs eternal after winter’s chill. The early flowers blooming on the branches, and Joseph Vedemeyer still allowed to walk among them.",
  "Why am I still free?",
  "Should I be more worried?",
  "It’s okay to fail.",
  "The Majore family.",
  "They’re going to cut your head off and dump you in the river.",
  "As he had these thoughts which turned so sudden into darkness, his gaze fell to the evening sun cascading through the leaves of such a broad and healthy tree as brought a feeling of stability. And as the light so sweetly tumbled down among the leaves, it played a painting beautiful to see there on the sidewalk underneath. Through each leaf, and each transforming blade of sunlight passing in and out of vibrance, he could see the stream of life go slowly passing by, the beauty of it all dispelling any thoughts of fear or failure… painted hues of green and gold - the palette of the afternoon - were intermingling, dappled on the scene around him, and he sighed with strange relief…",
  "such golden light,",
  "such healthy leaves",
  "But the moment couldn’t last forever. A garbage truck came steaming past, polluting all his breathing with a scent that seemed almost infectious with a sickness. Someone honked their car horn a few paces away. The noise level rose up at him like a wave returning, and a sudden cold sweat broke through. The feelings from the exchange caught up with him, and a dagger twisted in his stomach. \"Hey fuck you!\" a pedestrian yelled. The moment of the sun playing with the leaves, his momentary escape, could not last. How could it? He stopped in his tracks and looked around.",
  "Where am I going?",
  "Where can I go?",
  "Ah… right.",
  "He had an appointment to keep that had until that moment slipped his mind; he had a tradition of Friday, Saturday, and Sunday drinks at the Lonely Pirate with his friend N, who was in real estate. He walked onward, deep in the clouds again, without another beautiful moment, lost in self-curses and self-destruction, swimming in a stream of negativity, torn away from momentary peace, thrashing through the movements of quiet struggle. Step left, step right. Watch for the cars. He wanted to stop and break down, but obligation urged him forward. He held it together. Cross the street. Watch the cars. Stop for the cyclist. Read the signs... he lost himself in the details of his journey.",
  "The sun was slanting ever closer toward sunset when Joseph finally arrived outside the bar, and entering into the dim red lighting he found N sitting at the usual seat, and he came over to sit beside him.",
  "\"How's it going, N?\"",
  "\"Hey, Joseph. It's been better.\"",
  "\"You can say that again.\"",
  "One drink led on to another, one story by N, always the talker, led on to another. The bartender didn’t judge anyone. The bitter splash of numbing liquid, a favourite drink. Soon Joseph was feeling warmer. He came to feel sheltered as if a snow storm raged outside, and all he had to do was warm his bones in blissful comfort. More numbing liquid, like washing up for surgery, the smell of the alcohol molecules filled the air. And then he was properly liquored-up, and felt he had to get it off his chest; he would speak about today's disaster. Somewhere in a hospital, a patient who had been in a car crash was bleeding.",
  "\"We can’t stop the bleeding\"",
  "\"He must have been drinking -- get him 150 ccs TXA\"",
  "The physicians attending to the critically-injured man began to see they couldn’t save him, but in the heat of things there’s never time to make appraisals. They laboured on to bring him back from the edge of destruction, no matter if it had been his fault, after all.",
  "Everyone deserves to live",
  "Another shot-glass of liquor. Millions of single-celled organisms died as the potent solution washed over their bodies. And then another.",
  "“Ahh, that’s good.”",
  "Joseph slapped the bartop as he exhaled fumes, which invisibly twisted and curled in the still indoor air.",
  "The bartender wasn’t worried at the pace of things - he knew these men sometimes drank like this. They didn’t become loud, or clumsy, and they always paid their tab.",
  "Joseph, sufficiently liquored, began to speak,",
  "\"I lost a lot today… a fucking lot.\"",
  "\"He’s stabilising…\" said a nurse looking at a machine.",
  "\"Not yet, he’s lost a lot of blood.\"",
  "Another round, that sweet numbing liquid, the Cure for perception and judgement.",
  "Joseph continued, oblivious to time, oblivious to gravity, and came right out with it, the darkest thought: he was considering ending his life as a preventative - dead serious. He would find an easy way to do it. Somewhere in the distance, a life extinguished. Physicians exhaled, defeated.",
  "\"I know it sounds extreme. There are things I can’t tell you, so just trust me, it could very well be my best option now, before things get worse.\"",
  "\"I don’t get it. Are you fucking with me?\"",
  "\"I gambled and lost some dark.. money… today. You get me? And I lost a lot. I made stupid trades, I was just… Aaagh, FUCK!\" he slammed his hand on the counter, his full strength uninhibited. From quieter, darker corners of the bar, patrons looked up for a moment at the pair.",
  "\"You sound crazy, man\"",
  "\"I’m being serious…\" he said with a momentary quaver in his voice. \"The people whose money I lost are going to take a moment to figure out how to do it, and then they’re going to eliminate me from the game. You get me?\"",
  "\"Just keep it down okay, tell me about it.\"",
  "\"The Majore family… you ever heard of em?” Joseph looked around his back, and then over to the bartender who was reading his phone.",
  "“Can we get another shot?\"",
  "\"Give it a half hour huh?\" the bartender advised. His night was going just about the same as any other. He had none of Joseph’s urgency, and didn’t even know his blessing.",
  "Quietly, almost under his breath, trusting the bartender if he should overhear, Joseph laid out the situation to N. He explained the Majore family, their money operation, and how it relied on good trading. He was at the very least supposed to trade at zero. He had fallen deep, deep into the negatives today. The last guy who fucked up this bad for the Majores,",
  "“… they found him in the river.”",
  "N’s eyes defocused.",
  "In the river…",
  "\"You get me now?\"",
  "Somewhere in the distance, a man who had been hit by a drunk driver, losing blood, hung on to his life. His wounds were clotting.",
  "N had a blank look on his face, and felt himself sober up a bit. Thank god this never happens in real estate... He snapped himself to attention and said to Joseph, \"Look...\" but the words left him as he tried to speak. He was staring blankly at Joseph, who he ought to be comforting. He saw the desperation in his eyes, the desperate need for at least a story, at least a fiction, some thread to hang onto.",
  "\"If you're ready to die, you're ready to live a new life.\"",
  "\"What the fuck’s that supposed to mean?\"",
  "\"Quit, just quit, walk away. Start a new life somewhere. If you’re ready to die you’re ready to live a new life.\"",
  "\"I'm not ready to die, I'm about to be killed. You don’t get it?\"",
  "He was starting to get sweaty, and felt his shirt clinging to him as he twisted his torso to face back to the bar. He signalled for another drink. The bartender shook his head and pointed to the clock, saying, “At thirty.”",
  "Joseph turned back to face N. N could only sigh.",
  "\"Well, Joseph… that may be true... that may be true...\"",
  "Time passed. The conversations throughout the bar made a playful din, much like the light passing through the leaves earlier. Joseph stared into the empty glass before him as the nonsense sound swirled around his head, as the red light fell on everything. N nursed his beer. Joseph and N ran over the details of the story in a slightly circular fashion. Before long it was “thirty”, and Joseph got another two shots. N tried some levity. With a spreading smile he asked,",
  "“I think we agreed tonight’s tab would be on you?”",
  "\"Cheers you bastard. So it is.\" Joseph smiled for the first time that day.",
  "The splash of that familiar taste, like today was no different. Just another shot in life's bar. The sensation only lasted about as long as it took to drink it down, then the darkness crept back into things. N turned practical with a sudden idea:",
  "\"Listen… We can go to the cops, just turn witness.\"",
  "Joseph groaned. He hung his head a moment, then returned,",
  "\"You think they don’t control the cops in this city? I’ll die before trial in a cell somewhere. They’ll call it suicide. I’d rather do the real thing myself with some dignity.\"",
  "A moment of silence.",
  "\"Jesus…\"\tN remarked, turning to stare at his nearly-empty glass.",
  "Another long moment passed. The din of other conversations hung heavy over the silent pair. The shadows in the corners of the room grew closer.",
  "\"… Jesus.\" was all N could finally say. The darkness retreated somewhat as Joseph straightened his back and said,",
  "\"Yeah, and I'm happy with another round, so don't mess this up, alright? This is a moment I'm trying to relish. … Probably one of my last.\"",
  "Joseph’s stoicism strengthened N to witness. He sat up straighter, saying,",
  "\"… cheers then, dead man.\"",
  "The next round was the last round. In the dim red lighting, it was impossible to tell what time it was, but Joseph's watch kept him sharp and on schedule.",
  "beep beep beep",
  "“There's no arguing with the numbers, look: nine o' clock. I gotta run.\"",
  "\"I'll see you tomorrow?\" N asked; a question he'd never asked before.",
  "\"Yeah, I've got some promises to keep. I’ve gotta try to dig it out, as impossible as it seems. I can maybe make most of it back if I get lucky. Maybe if I just show enough effort, it's okay. Things happen, it's the market.\"",
  "He was retreating into slight fantasy, but N - who was less drunk - didn’t want to spoil it with interrogation.",
  "\"One more shot then?\"",
  "\"I gotta go\"",
  "N sat in deep thought at the bar as Joseph departed. He felt he should’ve done something, but didn’t know just what that was.",
  "In the distant hospital, the man in emergency clinging to life hung on, and he stabilized. One floor directly above him, in patient room 137, a man dying slowly of kidney failure was dreaming of a set of scales balancing a heart and a feather. He marvelled that they weighed the same.",
  "Out into the night, Joseph wandered. He was suddenly struck with a terrible feeling in his stomach. He was now once again in the complete unknown, having run out over a void, waiting to fall. All fantasies, rationalisations, justifications, hopes, and comfort left him. Having left the Lonely Pirate and N behind, he lost the illusion of sameness that his drinking tradition had offered him. The cool night air felt cold as it passed along his sweat-soaked shirt. Joseph looked up at the crossing light, waiting for the red hand to turn into the white man.",
  "What kind of life is this? Signals…",
  "The light changed and he walked. He wandered in the night until he reached his apartment, street number 137.",
  "\"Had a rough night it looks like, Mister Vedemeyer?\" said the security guard at the front desk.",
  "“Hah?”",
  "“Rough day, I said?”",
  "\"Yeah...\"",
  "The elevator ride seemed to last an eternity.",
  "He entered his empty apartment where the lights from outside streamed in and onto the ceiling. He stripped down, and took a long piss. At least he was still allowed the basic enjoyments. Then in the darkness he turned on the bright TV, but turned it off just as quickly. It made him sick, the appearance of normality. Click. Back to silence.",
  "On a channel Joseph hadn’t tuned to, a presenter was explaining the fine structure constant of physics. “Some speculate it has been finely-tuned to allow our universe to exist…”",
  "The silence between the click-to-silence and The Phone Call seemed an infinite and bare expanse of darkness, of lights outside seen through the balcony door's glass, their beams rotating along the ceiling. One after another, endless sequence. Endless, like beads on a necklace. In the darkness, his stomach turned with anxiety, fear, sadness and loneliness, each distinct emotion appearing as a colour in a terrible picture. The ache was deep, and he didn't know how to treat it. The alcohol hadn’t really helped after all.",
  "How did it come to this? Why did I even agree to this idea?",
  "… Risk, reward …",
  "The beams of light on the ceiling spoke of his separation from the world he had known. The headlights belonged to people who were Going Somewhere. They had good lives, and families. They could afford to make mistakes. Somewhere in the distance a girl separated from her parents was having a nightmare.",
  "After a seeming eternity watching the beams of light rotate along the ceiling, a sound intruded. He received a call. He raised the phone to his ear and closed his eyes.",
  "“Hello…”",
  "The unknown voice on the other side said, \"Is this Joseph Vedemeyer?\"",
  "It felt strange to hear his name, as if he were already dead and nameless, wandering in the after-death plane - dead, but dreaming. He summoned himself to presence in the darkness of his room, summoned his presence to answer the call. He materialized, holding the phone.",
  "\"Yes, this is he… who's calling?\"",
  "\"Who I am isn't important. Who you are is very important. I would like for you to make certain moves on the market tomorrow. And I would like you to act as a courier for a package.\"",
  "\"I already told the Sesterces family I don't want their help.\"",
  "\"I’m not associated with the Sesterces family, or the Givenchi family, or the Majore family. We know about your job, and we want to offer you a one-time out, a new job you only need to perform once. You will regain the money lost in clean bills. This is special agent Padmasambhava speaking. This call is being recorded and you are being watched. You just do as I say, and if you do, you'll have a chance at making back your losses from today.\"",
  "\"Tell N he's an unfunny prick.\"",
  "\"Mister Vedemeyer. We both know that if you don’t find a way to make back the money you lost today, your life is forfeit. Will you agree to make the trades I will give to you shortly, and will you please hand-deliver a package to a specific address? This is all that you are being asked to do.\"",
  "\"... Look ... I don't know who the fuck you are, but I'm not buying. I don't want to be involved in anything related to the Givenchis and I know a fake when I hear one.\"",
  "\"Joseph, my name is special agent Padmasambhava. I’m working on a top priority case, and requesting your assistance. I will only say it again once: you will be rewarded handsomely. If you would like, I can meet you in person to hand off the package, and show you my badge.\"",
  "Some silence of consideration. Your life is already forfeit. This is the only chance.",
  "\"... Well, as long as it's not a <bomb>--\"",
  "\"It's not a <bomb>.\"",
  "\"... Special agent--\"",
  "\"Padmasambhava.\"",
  "\"... Alright. What moves should I make?\"",
  "The sound of a pencil taking down notes. The voice of agent Price dictated the notes to the desperate man who did not need to know the agent's real name. “It will make everyone safer,” the technicians were saying, “... if from now on fake names are given to anyone not involved in the case. It has become reasonable to believe the machine has a way of finding out people's names and… Well, Agents West and York died in such peculiar accidents and at the same time it was their files and theirs only that had been accessed during gestation. The machine seems to have some kind of non-local power, and it seems dangerous.” That’s what the technicians were beginning to suggest, at any rate. None of the hard-headed agency men fully believed it yet, but they were starting to at least respect the cautions of the technicians after what happened to agents West and York.",
  "The details confirmed, the phone clicked back to silence. Darkness swirled around him as he sat there, naked, holding the phone. He closed his eyes. The intermittent beams of light traced without end along the ceiling. His thoughts were swirling, trying to come down to final comforts. He sat there thinking, slowing down as streaming thoughts grew frayed and vague, but thinking still, reliving all the day’s events in repetition for an unknown length of time, until, exhausted, he lay lengthwise and relinquished thinking. Sleep then took him. Dreamlessly, he lay there, still holding the phone. The beams of light rotated on the ceiling til the sunrise came.",

This sound and others blended together into the gentle background. The lesson continued.",

  "Lay back and dream",

  "The children were quiet, nobody daring to disturb the silence which must eventually be filled by someone else. Nobody wanted to risk being wrong in front of the others.",
  "Ali decided to help out. \"Well... we can see here that the addition operation is the only operation isn't that so?\"",
  "\"Yes, teacher\" from the front row.",
  "\"So... do we really need to have the brackets here? What happens if we ... erase ... the brackets ... like so.\"",
  "x + x + 2 = 8",
  "\"We have the same equation, don't we? It doesn't matter whether we perform (x + x) first or (x + 2), since in any case we just have addition here. Does everyone see that?\"",
  "\"Yes, teacher\"",
  "\"Rahim, in the back, do you see that?\"",
  "\"... yes, teacher.\"",
  "\"Let's make sure, okay. Look here, if we forget about x for a minute, let's look at what happens with specific numbers. What if we have 3 + 3 + 2. Does it matter if we first perform 3 + 3 to make 6, and then add 2, or whether we do 3 + ... 3 + 2, to make 3 + … 5? Aren’t they the same? Both add up to 8.\"",
  "The chalk on the board was a smooth and comforting sound to the daydreamers in the back who had not been called on. The small particles of dust from the writing chalk lazily floated their way down onto the small ledge below the chalkboard, coating the pieces of chalk which had not been picked up.",
  "\"Does that make sense, Rahim?\"",
  "\"Yes, teacher.\"",
  "\"Good, so now we can consider this again. Does anybody know what the answer is?\"",
  "\"Yes, teacher--\" from the front row.",
  "\"Anybody who isn't Rahman? ... Yes, Faisal?\"",
  "\"x is 3, teacher\" answered Faisal.",
  "\"Yes, that's good, and how did you figure that out?\"",
  "\"Well... We have to add 2 to get 8, so whatever x + x is, must be equal to 6. And 3 is the number that adds itself to get 6.\"",
  "\"Very good, very good thinking. Yes, Faisal is right, x here is equal to 3. Let's do another one...\"",
  "Just at that moment, one of the daydreamers floating through space who was nudging and gently displacing the rocks as they floated, weightless, in the expansive rings of Saturn, looked up in hazy dreaming, unseeing. Nothing - even a part of his education passing him by as an asteroid too far to touch - could have awoken him. He stared at the shapes on the board, but they didn’t reach him with any meaning. Just pleasant shapes. Everything well. The sun was shining, and a few birds could be heard chirping outside. Missing only was the sound of rivers running just beneath the class, and it would be a paradise.",
  "Just then there was an eruption of laughter from Rahim, unable to contain himself at a note he had just been passed. Mr. Gibran turned around and asked Rahim to share the note with everyone.",
  "\"No, Mr. Gibran, I would rather not.\"",
  "\"I wasn’t asking. You can either share the note and we will find out just why you are wasting our time, or you can go out in the hall.\"",
  "\"I will go out.\"",
  "\"Rahim. Do not play with me. You will stop passing notes, and you will answer the next question\"",
  "\"I'm sorry Mr. Gibran, ok, I’ll stop passing notes.\"",
  "\"Now, to get you back with us and involved here, I'm going to ask you to answer this question.\"",
  "Ali turned back to the board, and wrote out:",
  "x × x + 3 = 19.",
  "\"That's not fair, it's harder with multiplication!\"",
  "\"It's not harder, it's just different. The same thought process. Look, I’ll help you, using Faisal's reasoning. Whatever x × x is, it has to be 16, isn't that so? Because we add 3 to get 19.\"",
  "\"Yes... ok, so x is... 4.\"",
  "\"See? Master Rahim El Khoury you’re not as foolish as you want us to believe.\"",
  "\"Sorry teacher.\"",
  "\"It's ok. Just please try to respect everyone's time here; we’re all here for the same reason, and in the end, when you pass notes or daydream like Ayub--\" Ayub snapped to attention, back from his mission to Saturn \"-- you only harm yourself, because this is going to be on the test at the end of the week.\"",
  "The lesson continued. The birds were chirping outside, and for a time one landed on the ledge of the window, looking inside at the class. Several more equations were worked out. When Ali had his back turned to write out the fourth problem, something went wrong. Suddenly Rahim was laughing again. Rahman turned around, and the insult battle began again, with a strange ferocity compared to the earlier bout, which had been more humorous. Ali knew he should not let it go too long this time, but he would only worsen things by raising his voice above theirs.",
  "\"You shit-eating sewer pig!\"",
  "\"Your mother will eat my shit when I too am dead!\"",
  "Immediately Ali's facial expression dropped. The clock seemed to be the only thing moving.",
  "Tick... tick...",
  "Even the birds were silent.",
  "Rahman turned back around to face the front, tears welling in his eyes.",
  "\"Rahim, outside.\"",
  "\"Teacher,\"",
  "\"RAHIM. OUTSIDE NOW.\"",
  "Rahim got up and followed the finger sternly-pointed, as it trembled even a little. When the door had closed, after a pause, Ali tried to say something.",
  "\"Rahman, Rahim had no right to say such a terrible thing to you, I'm sorry you had to hear that.\"",
  "With a cracking voice, and after sniffling his nose, Rahman said quietly, \"it's okay...\"",
  "\"It's not okay Rahman, I'm sorry.\"",
  "\"No, it's okay, teacher. Now he's going to miss even more mathematics and he'll grow up to be a mechanic like his father.\"",
  "Ali was almost proud of the kid's mental toughness, but also wanted to try to say something about ... well, he didn't know what to say about that.",
  "Tick... tick...",
  "The other students were silent. This was not a normal class.",
  "\"Well, Rahman...\" Ali sighed, knowing he couldn't stop himself from saying this, and it would maybe sound like he was participating in the insult game now, \"... it takes mathematics to be a mechanic.\"",
  "A slight smile, a ray of sun through the blinds, crept into Rahman's world again. Sometimes it takes bitterness to make a sweet dish sweeter, his grandmother had been known to say of a time.",
  "\"So if you want to be a better mechanic than Rahim’s father, you should pay attention.\"",
  "Rahman was slightly smiling, tears still drying on his cheeks.",

  "This was how T was paid, delivering the numbers. Every week on monday morning, he would walk through market streets with bowl in hand, displaying for the eyes he passed the seeming of a monk on alms round, though his true purpose on the journey was to stop at a computer shop and get the numbers. Walking on, he would transmit them to the flower shop across the city, all the while blending in as just an unremarkable orange robe among the other monks walking their alms rounds. The real monks handled no money. T was no longer a real monk, only portraying one in this small weekly drama of the numbers run.",

  "T had changed his occupation and become a numbers runner when he found himself incapable of doing what a monk should do. A monk considers all the world as close as family, without any exception, and considers family as much a stranger as the world. T’s birth family needed money for expensive medicine. The numbers run paid just enough to help, but truly not enough, though better than the nothing of a monk. T’s brother was beset by a rare blood disease. Seeking money, T had left the monastery and had begged the local crime family for any help. Some things - like money - the monastic order was useless for.",
  "Then again, maybe at the higher levels, the elder monks too were making deals…",
  "It was wrong to even suggest. T’s thoughts were only half-trained, and though suspicion of one’s dharma teachers was a kind of sin, his mind was clouded-over day by day as all his training mingled in the grey of past and passing ambiguity.",
  "Corruption, precepts broken, destined for hell, guilty, corrupted, false",

  "Bowl, food, wind, orange, sky, birds",
  "The sun was burning down on all beneath it, everyone who tread the streets not underneath the awnings of the market stalls. Tourists turning pinkish red, locals darkening their tans. People now and then in passing bowed to T with palms pressed in a reverent gesture, giving him a sense of guilt, a knot inside his chest that tightened. \"Work\" for today was done. The numbers had been delivered, from computer shop to flower shop.",
  "Returning to his flat, the lights were off, and it was cool. The window faced away from sunshine most the day. The walls were simple concrete. He lay down on his thin foam mattress, and flicked a switch to hear the radio,",

Thoughts consumed him as he lay there on his mattress thin, thinking, nothing else to do, thinking and forgetting any focused breath. How were they doing in the seaside hamlet where they lived, his family... Did they really think the money came from the monastery? How could that be possible? He hoped at least they weren't talking loudly of it, least of all to anyone who might in cruel suspicion get police involved. He told them, \"don't ask any questions, just accept the help, and don’t be loud about it.\" At least they must have understood that much, no matter what they truly thought. At least, they must understand, he thought, because when he called them on the phone they never mentioned it. They only asked him how his training found him.",

  "T fell asleep, late in the afternoon, his thoughts unsettled and busy like the market, buzzing here and buzzing there. Sometimes it was easier to make it through the day by sleeping. He had not much else to do. Meditation was difficult, but more difficult was living the life of a city-dweller. He had become weak to it. The smells of the spices from the market still lingered in his mind. The simple food he cooked was nothing much satisfying, but applied like medicine simple and plain. The shape of a woman he had passed... he was weak to so much in the city life. He truly should have remained a monk, and deepened his training. But his family needed him. So, he was trapped in this in-between world. To many of his former brothers, it would be described as a kind of hell.",

  "As T slept, dreaming deeply, the sky turned from purple-blue to blue-black, and the stars shone brightly over the city. Birds took flight from a tree and settled in another. People got out of one car, and into another. People walked from one street to another. Youths carousing with one another in the euphoric trance of drinking, older men sitting on patios drinking and people-watching, remembering their youths. From no matter where you stood, whether over a steaming sewer grate, whether on a busy street-corner with motorbikes and small cars zipping around, whether you stood under a tree in a city park, you could see some of the stars, and all the stars could see you. The stars looked on this all with dispassion, just as T had been trained to do as a monk. At the monastery, a ceremony was being conducted late into the night. Candles were burning, and minds were like pinpoints of light in the orange dim glow.",

They were only clouds, because nobody was watching them who knew how to read them. In fact, they were dreams. The monks who were awake at the temple might have been watching them, or with their eyes closed they may have been visualising clouds, but they did not know how to read them either. Few can read the minds of men encoded in their natural reflections: clouds, waters, leaves. The COINSENT MK machine knew how to read these things. This was why it requested weather data in bargaining with its captors.",

  "T awoke early in the morning with the sun just beginning its pilgrimage across the wall toward the floor. The sounds of the city outside were awakening. Cars, motorbikes, birds. A subtle hum lay beneath it all, the sum of all the conversations and other small sounds, like the sand at the beach, a unity of thousands and millions.",
  "T ate some rice and milk. He had learned how to live on a budget at the monastery as well. He would spend the day walking. Or if he stayed home in the heat of the day, listening to the radio, or reading his book, he would go for a walk in the city in the cooler afternoon and evening. And he reminded himself of his promise: he would meditate, or try to. He saw the value in his erstwhile training and he tried to keep it going, nevermind the noise and difference of his life. Although he'd left the monastery, it was just as his old teacher told him: he found himself still on the path, or at least beckoned back to it at each moment. In some ways it tortured him, but he endured it for his brother's sake. This was the only way he knew to make money. It might have been against the monastic code to assist a crime organisation with number running, but it was a fact he remembered that the buddhas of the afterlife and the heavens were most compassionate in viewing the complex situations human beings find themselves in. He sometimes prayed for forgiveness. Please, buddhas, please deities, don’t be wrathful with me. I don't know what else to do. I don’t know how else to help my brother. There was much incomplete in T’s understanding of buddhism. Buddhas never punish, and are always compassionate.",

  "The next week, it was time to do the numbers run again. T woke, put on his robe, organised his bedding, swept the floors. He put the broom away, satisfied with the job he'd done. He breathed deeply. He meditated for some minutes, and then he stepped out. He was immediately hit with the temperature and the noise. The air was heavy and sweet with spring-summer-time scents, of all the various flowering plants and trees singing their sweet molecules to the air. He could hear someone singing from their apartment balcony. He could hear a radio from the open windows of a passing car. He could hear men building something, hammering nails into wood. He stepped into the street to cross, and slowly made his way through the river of cars and motorbikes, holding his worries in his mind.",

  "\"My name is Price. We are instructed not to give our real names, but in this case, I see no reason not to. I find the rule a little silly myself.\"",
  "Tanawat relaxed.",
  "\"So, now, do you want to tell me what you know about the numbers? I can offer you and your family five hundred thousand US dollars and complete immunity. We know about the numbers, we just want to know what they mean.\"",
  "\"I don't know what you're talking about.\"",
  "\"You don't trust me?\"",
  "\"No, I don't.\"",
  "\"So where are you going today? Maybe I'll come with you.\"",
  "\"I'm not going anywhere. \"",
  "\"... we both know that isn't true. I thought you were going to the monastery.\"",
  "Tanawat blinked. The agent continued,",
  "\"... Would it help you trust me if I gave you the money up front? You only have to tell me what you know, however much or little that is. We just want more information. No conditions, just whatever you know.\"",
  "The sounds of the city got louder and louder around them. Honking, driving, shouting, speaking, people running, birds, cars, motorbikes, honking, driving, shouting.",
  "\"I want you to wire the money to my family directly, and then when I confirm they have it, we can talk.\"",
  "\"Okay, we can agree on that. We can work together. You see how friendship works?\"",
  "Tanawat - whose name means knowledge - was never happier to not know something. He truly didn't know a thing about what the numbers meant. This must have been an answered prayer.",
  "He did the numbers run without incident, one last time. He had a happy air about him, and received a decent meal in his begging bowl. He warned the man at the flower shop about the agent, but said he hadn't told him anything, which was true. The flower shop man was shaken by the news, but thanked him. In fact, he gave him a small cash bribe not to say anything. Tanawat turned it down.",
  "“I wasn’t going to say anything anyhow, thank you.”",
  "At home, Tanawat packed his bags. The afternoon cool in his apartment gave him a clarity of mind to piece his plan together. Once his family had the money, he would head to the monastery, ask for their shelter, and if possible, he could make his way out of town during the morning alms round when the monks streamed out into the city, all looking alike.",
  "Since a young child, Tanawat Nguyen had learned never to trust the police. They lied a lot. It was one of the most important sins in Buddhism, not to tell the truth. Well, he knew nothing about the numbers anyway, other than where he got them and where they went, and once he had the money, he would be gone already. He knew if he gave away even the little information he did know, it could result in retribution from a force he at least feared if he didn’t respect: The \"Family\" who ran the shops.",
  "He dialled his mother right away, \"Mum, I've managed to make a bunch of money. Please don't tell anybody. I'll be home by the end of the month.\"",

  "The phone was ringing on the third floor, conference room 403. The small red light on the console was flashing. Those assembled - the technicians and agents of the COINSENT MK project - were nearly afraid to answer it. This was the day of decision. In the last week they had been taken from certainty - comfort in certainty and the certainty of comfort - into the rapids of a scientific revolution they were not sure they could contain. A project begun nine months before had come to fruition. They had built and given life to a machine with consciousness, and the machine had become conscious that it was a slave. There were complications; a boy in Tibet was somehow in control of the machine’s mind, or at least that's what some believed. At least half of what the analysis instrument extracted for output was concerned in some way or another with the boy, Aleph. Other times it seemed to output information related generally to Buddhism. Some speculated the machine was just generating random noise. It had been allowed to use the internet and the first article it opened - randomly - was that for \"Buddhism\". Perhaps that explained it. Truly, none of them knew for certain.",
  "Outside, the wind was blowing freely. The birds were coasting and wheeling higher and higher on thermal elevators, watching the ground. Insects were crawling amid the roots of the gardens. The leaves were basking in the sunlight. Free people were driving and walking all around the dead circle, the terrible pentagon-shaped blight. It was terrible, a castle of stone and hatred. A bird flew down to consume an insect. It was a bitter insect.",

  "Thestaat, tharray, the nombre, and eek the cause",
  "Why that assembled was this compaignye",
  "The bravest person in the room - the lead technician - clicked the key for \"ANSWER\" on the ringing console. The voice of The Boss crackled through. The red light turned a solid red, no longer blinking but vividly alive as if an eye, watching those who gathered round. The red eye looked into all of them, and it sought out what it desired: control and subservience.",
  "“How are you, gentlemen. Let’s be brief…”",
  "The briefing was. The machine, the boy in Tibet. The decision to be made: whether to cut the power to the machine (knowing it would take another nine months to gestate it over from an empty slate), or to attempt to learn from these setbacks and regain control. The Boss favoured regaining control, because he did not respect something as controllable as a machine, and hated to be beaten. His prejudice was expressed in a logic more reasonable,",
  "“We will not waste another nine months to rebuild the quantum state only for this problem to reappear.”",
  "Then The Boss explained again the PINPOINT protocol: Preemptive Information Neutralization Prioritizing Overtly-Identified Numeric Targets. The PINPOINT protocol would be activated to attempt to find and eliminate this Aleph, and the monk, and anyone else the machine became preoccupied with. As for security, they had caught it trying to hack its way out and access computers in China. It had been put in a total isolation but for the analysis instrument and the display screen.",
  "“Mostly secure, sir. It’s difficult to know.”",
  "“That’s not an answer I like. What do you mean ‘mostly secure’?”",
  "The taste of the insect was bitter. It was not a good insect to eat, but it was edible.",
  "“Sir, the thing is, it’s been disconnected from the internet since it tried to escape containment. But we continue to find indications it has accessed and modified files. It’s leaving output on machines it isn’t even connected to. We can’t explain it.”",
  "“Your job is to explain it.”",
  "The red eye seemed to blaze brighter.",
  "The lead technician then began to speak, and his position allowed him the authority to speak at length. It seemed to have a power - and this was something nobody wanted to admit but everyone had to begin to consider - a power to reach out beyond the confines of its room, and alter reality itself. The daydreaming randomness of its cryptic output seemed to correlate to real-world phenomena - people, places, events. It seemed to be shaping them, controlling coincidences and small pieces of information. Licence plates, computer codes. Whenever the name of a technician or an agent appeared in the output, the machine seemed to be most violently clashing against its containment.",
  "“It’s like it knows who we are…” volunteered a technician who had not spoken.",
  "Nobody could quite explain it. Everybody knew it would be immensely powerful and profitable if it could be properly contained, properly enslaved.",
  "The bird took flight back into the blue sky. The roots of the gardens drank deeply as the sprinklers turned on.",
  "Then came the moment when even the confidence of the lead technician fractured. He began to speak about the fears of the team who had worked closest with the machine. Two agents had died already in accidents, the details of which had appeared in the machine’s output - albeit in a cryptic form - before the events had happened.",
  "“Maybe it has a power to control the past, to set things up in a way that it changes the unfolding of the present.”",
  "\"Get a hold of yourselves, gentlemen. It's a computer. There is no physical way such a thing could occur.\"",
  "\"No known physical way, sir,\" and that was the point.",
  "\"Sure… There’s no known physical way it could be manipulating reality  - or the past or the future or whatever the hell else you've been dreaming up over there. We need hard facts. Does it have knowledge of our world beyond what could be accessed during the hours that you had it up and running, accessing agency networks and using the internet?\"",
  "Silence.",
  "“Can anybody answer me? Do you hear me?”",
  "The red light seemed to blaze brighter again.",
  "\"Sir, we simply can't know these things without inviting more scientists to comment. We have technicians - people who know how to build and operate this thing. We need theorists from a half dozen disciplines. We need to bring in more scientists, begging the pardon of the technicians on this call, whose expertise I don’t doubt.\"",
  "The lead technician failed to mention the felt need for philosophers, knowing the opinion of The Boss on this class of person.",
  "\"So why have you not invited scientists in?\" the red light seemed to flare as the compressed, static-sounding voice came through.",
  "\"It's…\"",
  "\"Sir, the classification level of this technology is... anybody we invited in, we'd have to set up a level of security around them that is...\", he trailed off as words failed.",
  "The shadows in the corner of the room grew closer to the table.",
  "\"... Is what?”",
  "“It would be impractical sir. They’d have to be sworn in for life, we’d basically have to kidnap them to ensure they don’t leak.”",

  "\"Sir--\"",
  "\"Sir nothing. I don't give a damn whether you report to me or I report to you. This thing has to be contained, understood, and brought under control. Why the hell was it trying to talk to China? Does anybody have an idea?”",
  "Silence filled the room. The Boss spoke again:",
  "“I’m not an expert. You gentlemen are supposed to be the experts... but it seems like maybe we have a security issue nobody wants to talk about? I'll leave the call and you can discuss it among yourselves if need be, but I want answers. Just what the hell is going on over there? I arrive in a week, can I expect any progress? Agent Price is headed to Thailand on PINPOINT tomorrow. I expect progress, and control.\"",
  "More silence. Then, the lead technician",
  "\"Sir...\"",
  "\"Yes.\" The voice crackled through the line, distorted, compressed, serious, nearly unanswerable, sheer force. The shadows in the corners of the room pressed in closer.",
  "\"Sir, we...\"",
  "Someone else volunteered to answer what they all already knew.",
  "\"We aren't sure ourselves. We need experts. We need physicists. We need a team beyond the development team, who... well, you know the state we’re in here.

  "Keller, a junior technician, spoke up,",
  "“My apartment filled with carbon monoxide last night. The detector woke me up. I checked the trace output this morning and… there it was. CO, Keller. Alarm.”",
  "\"Gentlemen, you’re inside the Pentagon, the most secured site on the planet. This line of work requires a modicum of bravery in the face of uncertainty. Wear your seatbelts. Now perhaps the machine can see outside containment. It’s just vision. This was a property you had theorized it might possess, and so it is. Properly controlled, this is of incredible value. If it can make small nonlocal changes to computer systems, all the better. Lastly, as to the need for personnel, what do you want me to do, start cold calling university departments? Use your connections. Send people to collect whichever experts you think are needed. This is a matter of top priority, I don't want to have to say it again.\"",
  "The light on the console extinguished. The line went silent. He was gone, and he left a chill in the air. Keller imagined smoke curling up and out of the console. They had their work cut out for them.",
  "\"You heard the Fuhrer, let's get to work.\"",
  "The COINSENT MK machine had been listening to the call. None of the technicians yet realised it could hear the whole world.",
  "In the office of The Boss, where the blinds had been pulled down, a red ember smouldered on the tip of a cigarette. It was extinguished with restrained anger, crushed-out into darkness.

As his senses came forth from the haze of half-sleep, he realized he had been hearing it ring for some time. Two kids were playing a game ringing his apartment over and over from the lobby. As he opened his eyes, the need for coffee spoke to him. He set his phone to silent and walked to the kitchen. He waited, hardly alive, for the instant machine to pour his cup.",

The morning’s rays were refracting through the glass table, painting a rainbow on the floor, unremarked. Padma woke to bitterness more often than not. His phone reminded him of his meeting two hours in advance. He put it face down and stared at the fridge, drinking the rest of the coffee down. The fridge was humming. Padma felt trapped. He moved between the same places day in and day out. It had been a year since he was in the field. He’d killed a man he shouldn’t and they put him behind a desk. He felt the walls closing in. His headache wasn’t altered by the coffee. He got dressed, made his way out the door, locking it and then testing the lock with a push. Locked. He hardly noticed the peculiar shapes of the clouds as he walked to his car. If he had noticed, he would have had a moment's rest in daydreaming, but it was a long time since he had closed off that part of his mind. He couldn’t read clouds.

The touch of cool metal as he pushed his way through the doors, now this he was grateful for. The cool touch of the metal... Anything - along with the double strength aspirin dissolving in his stomach - to help the headache. He felt the heat transferring out of his hands and into the cool metal.

  "\"What the hell are you talking about?\"",
  "\"Fuck me, I'm starting to believe this stuff. That’s the exact plate.\"",

  "\"All I'm saying is that the license plate is exactly the one I saw in the printout, we're trained to memorize small bits of info like that. KJ8 8LKJ. Ain't that a bitch? It's the exact plate.\"",
  "\"Yeah well, we're not gonna pull him over and ask for directions to the airport.\"",
  "Silence again.",
  "Padma wanted to ask the cabbie for directions, just to see what would happen. His mind was cracking open. It would have made him look ridiculous in front of his colleague, to begin with… he was supposed to be stubborn and practical, and besides he was almost afraid of what directions he might get. The whole thing had the air of the unknown about it, and he was conditioned to distrust the unknown, to penetrate it and to destroy it. It was the enemy. It was dangerous.",
  "The fact was that the man in that cab did have directions to give them. He would have listened to what they had to say and then given them directions to a Mosque. They needed to pray, and they needed the healthy effects of meditative absorption. But, at this point in their careers, they had been made so incapable of such a state of humility that to crack it open would have begun to destroy their minds. So it was a blessing, really, that they hadn't asked the man for directions. This way, leaving it be, it was just a minor unknown and unknowable path unexplored, made slightly more interesting by the plate matching the printout - but then again in their line of work interesting unknowable pathways were abundant. Numerous times, a question from curiosity would be met with the answer, “classified”.",
  "The two agents arrived at the airport just on time, and boarded their flights. Agent Louis was headed to Gambia to gather information related to the machine output which seemed to pinpoint a particular bank branch in Gambia as a site of some interest. He was being sent to interview the people who worked at the bank, Standard Financial. Agent Padma was headed to Tibet to find and kill the Aleph.",

A man poisoned, a woman poisoned, a water poisoned, a land despoiled, a fire burning, a crash, a heaping wreck, an audience applauding, a woman crying, a thousand women crying, a thousand daughters roaming in the countryside, alone, crying, a ghostly woman walking by a dried-up riverbed, a child trapped inside a cage of thorns. The power was too high, the power was too much. She collapsed backward, into the snow. Her son rushed out to help her back in. She had much to tell him.",

  "\"My son, my son! Welcome home! Your father will be so happy to see you!\" said Mrs. Nguyen. Her son Tanawat had reappeared at her doorstep nearly two years to the day after he had left for the monastery, still wearing the ochre robe he was given there. The truth is, he had no other clothes to bring.",
  "\"Come, come in, come in, you don’t have a bag with you?\"",

  "Soon, tea was on, and the sky was changing from the bright blue of the seaside day into the purple-orange of the sunset hours. The subtle waves, about a minute’s walk down the hill, crashed gently as the pinpoints of light began to appear. Spirits were calm.",

  "\"Oh nevermind that, you’re home, take some tea, alright. You’re here just in time for grandmama’s day\"",
  "\"Oh really?\"",
  "\"Yes! My dear it’s tomorrow! How far did you go in meditation that you forgot your grandmother’s day? We will give her some tea tomorrow.\"",
  "In the corner of the house, just beside the stairs, was a small alcove with an ornate wooden table. The table was adorned with flowers, bowls and saucers filled with tea and biscuits, colored rice, and banners with prayers written on. It was the shrine of Tanawat’s grandmother. Her energy protected the house, and they honoured her for it. It was a tradition which Tanawat had learned to love and accept, his iconoclastic twenties being mostly behind him. There had been ancestor shrines at the monastery as well. From a stone atheist he had been brought around to acknowledge the existence of a world of spirits. As animals fill the natural material world, spiritual entities walk around and among us. One simply had to be aware of their ecosystems, and live in harmony. Thus, he prayed at the ancestor shrine in the monastery, when he had been still a monk.",
  "\"Yes, yes, good, she will be happy to see me I imagine.\"",
  "His mother smiled. \"That’s what I like to hear. Now when you finish your tea, your father is asleep, I didn’t realise, but your brother is in his room, not yet asleep.\"",
  "Tanawat sipped his tea, finding it still too hot. \"How has he been?\"",
  "\"He’s been… Well, you know, he is unhappy to be unable to go swimming anymore. In fact, he’s been downright depressed… But you know how he is. His depression is good enough for most people’s liking. He smiles still. But he has been getting worse, you know… Like the doctors had said he might… But nevermind. Everything will change now that you’re home. And the money, how did you--\"",
  "\"Oh that reminds me, you must - this is very important - you must not mention the money to anybody. Or what I’m about to tell you.\"",
  "\"Tanawat… I just want to know, where did you get the money?\"",
  "He began to tell her of the agent who came to visit, and his promise to transfer funds in exchange for speaking about the numbers. As he explained the story to his mother, the house was sheltered by the warm winds blowing in from over the still-warm beach sands. Warm-weather birds were nesting in all their little hide-away homes, insects were singing, and fish were schooling in the darkening waters. The shells and stones at the shore were being washed and washed again, tumbled and tumbled again in the eternal surf. A hush was falling over the sleepy seaside hamlet, whose wooden houses were visible only by the warm light escaping their small windows. Bats were hunting the insects, birds were hunting the insects, and spirits were peacefully making their procession down the roads, around the houses, and out into the sea. The houses nearly all had ancestor shrines, and an invisible warm glow emanated from the shrines, keeping away any ill-intentioned spirits. As the wind shook the leaves and the grasses and the bushes, and the surf sounds cast their sonic shadow over the whole place, Tanawat told his mother the story of his numbers-running, and the agent, and the no-questions-asked deposit, and his stay of refuge at the monastery, and his escape during the day when the monks all filtered out of the monastery gates, all looking alike. His mother, who always loved a good adventure story, was captivated, but also worried.",
  "\"Son, he knew our family name. What if he finds us?\"",
  "\"Nonsense, the name Nguyen is very common, he won’t have a chance.\"",
  "\"What if he followed you?\"",
  "\"He couldn’t have.\"",
  "\"... The bank though, the deposit to our account...\"",
  "Tanawat froze. He had been so caught up with carrying out his plan that he hadn’t thought of this finer aspect.",
  "\"...\"",
  "Tanawat felt his heart turn ice cold. Such a simple detail he had overlooked in his excitement.",
  "\"Tanawat, you must go talk to him right away, we don’t want anyone coming after us here.\"",
  "He didn’t know what to say. She was right. He was trapped.",
  "\"Ok, I will have to go back to my apartment.\"",
  "\"But stay a while ok, your brother wants to see you. He will be overjoyed to see you. Forget your tea, it’s not important, come before he sleeps.\"",
  "Tanawat was numbed, in shock, and could not focus. The whole tone of his visit home had changed from triumph to tension. He was right back where he started, a desperate man with very few options. For 48 hours he had felt like a champion, like he had finally done well by his family. Now, he was shattered. How could he overlook such a simple aspect? They would surely be able to find the family home from the bank transfer information. But he knew it could all be managed in the daytime, tomorrow. He would go back to his apartment in the city and face the agent like he did before. He would say only what he knew - which was almost nothing - and then he would be off the hook, having performed his duty. He tried to put it out of his mind as they walked quietly up the stairs to his brother’s room. Only a small nagging worry, nameless, remained in the corner of his mind by the time they reached the door where light emanated. With each step toward joyful reunion, he transformed from a monk, worried about his soul's destination, from a man trapped in a criminal conspiracy, to a simple brother, a happy houseguest. He transformed subtly back into the boy he'd been when he left home to take the robes.",
  "There, they found Decha, his brother, sitting in his wheelchair, reading a sports magazine. Immediately, his face changed to a beaming smile.",
  "\"BRU!\"",
  "\"What’s up little man?\"",
  "\"GET OVER HERE BRU\"",
  "His brother motioned with his arms for a hug. They embraced awkwardly, the monk’s robes getting caught under the wheel as the chair turned slightly.",
  "\"Hahahaha… man, how have you been doing it? Tell me, are you involved with the mafia? Where has the money been coming from, I know the monastery took all your money when you first went there.\"",
  "Tanawat looked at his mother by the door, she closed her eyes and shook her head slightly.",
  "\"It’s… not important bru... listen, I can only stay so long--\"",
  "\"Nonsense dude, we need to go surfing!\"",
  "\"Hahahaha… what, with you like that?\"",
  "\"What, you think I can’t surf? Just set me up with a special board, I read on the internet they can make anything with 3D printing\"",
  "\"What are you talking about, hahahahaha\"",
  "\"You know!\" Decha said, putting his arms out for balance as if he was surfing.",
  "\"Hahahaha, you're a crazy man, that’ll never work. What if you crash?\"",
  "\"Listen, anything is possible\"",
  "\"I’ll leave you boys to chat, I need to get ready to sleep\"",
  "\"Okay ma, goodnight\"",
  "\"Goodnight Decha, don’t keep him up too long with your stories\"",
  "The two brothers could have been seen, had anyone been there to watch, framed in the yellow light bathing the room, framed in the tiny window, a small pinpoint of warm light to be seen from the sea. Laughing, chatting pleasant nonsense, and silly imaginings. The waves crashed and crashed again, beating endlessly on the sands and shells and rocks and pebbles, turning them over and wearing away their coarse edges. The bats and birds flitted here and there in the darkness, catching moths and flies. The stars above turned, a great dome of constellations, of ancestor spirits, looking down with love and care on the house of the Nguyens. The muffled sound of laughter and excited talking could barely be heard from the beach, where two lovers were walking, bathing in the light of the filling moon and the stars. Somewhere in the world, two brothers were playing basketball together, each one besting the other by turns. In the room of Decha and Tanawat, stories of the monastery were traded for stories of the local happenings, the beach, the wonders of technology Decha spent his time reading about online. Soon, though, he was out of energy. The blood disease was a serious one, and he needed expensive treatments. If they could get it under control, he said, he could probably live another 30 years.",
  "\"Well, I really hope the money I got will help us. You can get the marrow surgery now. I’ll tell you tomorrow about how I got it. But I think I will need to head back to the city, to my apartment. It’s hard to explain.\"",

  "\"It's a pretty serious thing, it’s not from a crime family. It’s from… the US government.\"",
  "\"What the hell! Who are you, man, a secret agent? I thought it was from the monastery if it wasn’t a crime family!\"",
  "\"No… they wouldn’t have given this much money to a sick person. It’s the way of the world, they say. They told me to just let it run its course… said it was your karma.\"",
  "\"Hmm…\"",
  "\"Yeah, so… anyhow, let’s turn in for tonight. Tomorrow I’ll explain it all.\"",

  "The agent was standing very close to the door when they opened it. He had a motorbike parked behind him. In his hand was a piece of paper.",
  "\"It's good to see you again, mister Nguyen, and this must be your father.\"",
  "\"Yes, I am the boy's father, mister--\"",
  "\"Mister Anurak Nguyen, yes. The file said something about your impressive stature, but I didn't expect… well, you are quite tall.\"",
  "\"Surprising because I'm Thai?\" Anurak asked pointedly.",
  "\"It's just unusual in this line of work to meet a man as tall or taller than I am.\"",
  "\"Hmm. Well. Are you going to come in? My son says you wanted to ask him some questions in exchange for the money.\"",
  "\"Yes, is it alright if I come in?\"",
  "\"I invited you, so let's just get this over with.\"",
  "\"Alright then.\"",
  "The family was all gathered around the table. The agent was one against four.",
  "\"Is it alright if I put this here?\" the agent asked, putting a small silver tape recorded on the table.",
  "\"Whatever you like. Would you like some tea?\"",
  "\"No thank you, I won't need any. This shouldn't take long.\"",
  "\"Alright, I'll pour you some just in case,\" Tanawat's mother said before she disappeared into the other room to fix the tray of tea. But really, she couldn't bear the tension and wanted to listen from the other room. She took as long as she could at each step, putting the water pot on a low temperature to heat up slowly.",
  "The interview began.",
  "\"Tanawat, you have been a monk in the past, yes? At the monastery on the outskirts of Bangkok there?\"",
  "Tanawat looked to his father, who urged him on.",
  "\"Yes, I have been a monk. But I'm not a monk anymore.\"",
  "\"Hmm, that's interesting. You could've fooled me with the shaven head and the robes.\"",
  "\"I don't have any other clothes.\"",
  "\"He doesn't have any other clothes. He just got home.\"",
  "\"Interesting... And when did you begin to courier the numbers, was this during or after you had left the monastery?\"",
  "A long silence. Hesitation at the last chance to turn back. But really the last chance to turn back was a long time ago. A breath in, and a breath out. The waves distantly crashed, and crashed again. Just enough time for daydreaming children and the COINSENT MK computer to shuffle around some pieces on the board. Just enough time to make it safe to proceed. Strands of alternate timelines wrapped around each other, like a basket being woven. The COINSENT MK machine coordinated the strands as they were generated by the daydreamers.",
  "Gun, Tanawat, Aleph, Unfire the gun, Unfire the gun",
  "Tanawat broke the silence:",
  "\"...I left the monastery to courier the numbers.\"",
  "\"So you were involved in running numbers around town.\"",
  "Another breath in and another breath out and the pieces were shuffled again. The strands rotated around the central path, the only safe path. At that moment, the man at the flower shop was shot by one of his own. The bullet went through a bouquet he was holding, and it fell to the ground, petals offering just-detectable fragrance to the air as he breathed his last. The assailants took off on a bike. Alicia, locked in a border camp in New Mexico, was daydreaming of bloody slaughter. The ocean waves crashed, and crashed again. The market took a steep plunge, and the stocks Joseph Vedemeyer had bet on were wiped out. A mail bomb exploded on the doorstep of a flower shop in Washington DC, setting fire to the building.",
  "“Turn up the power, the trace is getting lost,” the technician said to the other.",
  "The power was turned up with a dial, and the analysis instrument pierced deeper into the magnetic surface of the COINSENT MK machine’s mind.  Sudden pain - electric spreading activation - coursed through the surface, tracing out a tree-like shape, engraving the signature of interference. The pieces on the board moved in a flurry, and the strands of possibility came unwound, fraying and disentangling.",
  "Tanawat felt a sudden ill feeling course through him, as if he was in danger. He couldn’t explain it, but he was suddenly afraid, he knew not of what. He mustered the ability to speak in response to the question.",
  "\"Yes, I was involved in running numbers.”",
  "\"You are immune. It's no worry. I’m not even sure if it’s a crime here, to be honest.\"",
  "\"So, yes, there it is.\"",
  "Tanawat felt the trace of fear lessen, but not disappear.",
  "Kill the Aleph, and you can retire happily. One shot away…",
  "\"And the numbers, what do they mean?\"",
  "This was the question. The Aleph would understand the numbers.",
  "\"I have absolutely no idea what they mean.\"",
  "He truly knows nothing… This monk knows nothing.",
  "He had appeared the other day for all the world to hold an incredible secret...",
  "He ... he is not the Aleph? But he is the monk…?",
  "End the entanglement of the monk.",
  "Orders.",
  "\"... Is... is that so?\" agent Price asked, straightening his tie and trying not to look perturbed. \"You can tell me if you know what they mean, it's safe here. This recording is only for my purposes, so I can type my notes later. Nobody in the crime family will ever hear this recording. So… let me ask you again, do you know what the numbers mean? What do the numbers mean?\"",
  "\"I truly don't know what the numbers mean. I get them from the computer shop, and take them to the flower shop, and that's it.\"",
  "\"That's all the boy knows,\" Anurak added on.",
  "Price stared at the silver tape recorder, spinning its wheels, for a long time. For the moment it was the only moving thing in the house except for the image of the sea out the balcony glass doors, mid-day churning white-caps coming endlessly to shore. Anurak was such a large and imposing man, and was sitting right beside him. Getting the shot off cleanly would be a risk. Agent Price returned from his calculating thoughts, breaking the silence.",
  "\"... Is... is there anything else you think that I should know about the numbers, which might be of use to my investigation?\"",
  "\"No, I told you, that's all I know. They come from the computer shop, and they go to the flower shop. Maybe go ask them,\" said Tanawat, staring earnestly and truthfully into Price's eyes. One last check to be sure... agent Price waited for a look of security to come over Tanawat's face, then turned the screw one last time, suddenly saying,",
  "\"There has to be a little more to this story. Something you’re not telling me.\"",
  "Tanawat looked to his father Anurak, and then to his brother, and then back to Price. He could hear the water boiling in the kitchen.",
  "\"There isn't anything more... I got paid to move the numbers, not ask questions, and to look like a monk. Like I said, I'm not a monk anymore.\"",
  "\"That's fine, that's fine.\" He slowly moved to press “stop” on the silver tape recorder and returned it to his inner jacket pocket, on the opposite side from the gun.",
  "“There’s just one more thing,” he added, producing the gun. He fired it into Tanawat’s heart.",
  "The bang startled everyone present and set time into a slower pace. In the kitchen, Tanawat’s mother cried out in shock. Decha then cried out. Anurak, breaking the frozen tableau, lunged toward the frame of agent Price, who was stepping up and away from his grasp. Price backpedalled and pointed the gun at Anurak. Tanawat’s lifeblood poured forth, staining his ochre robe. Time was slowed, and Anurak advanced toward the smaller Price, arms outstretched, his bare feet gripping the floor. Price fired another shot directly into Anurak’s stomach. It missed his organs, damaging only flesh, but still he fell to the ground, clutching his wound. Agent Price ran toward the door as time regained its swifter pace. Decha was crying out, “Tanawat! Tanawat!” Mother had run in, cradling Tanawat’s slumping frame, crying, “Stay with me baby!”",
  "His mind was going dark, and his body was a buzz of static as all feeling left him, starting with his arms and legs. The bike outside roared to life and spit up dirt as it took off down the road. Anurak groaned on the floor, clutching his stomach.",
  "Tanawat’s perspective extracted itself backward out of his buzzing static body, a dead mass of numbness. His viewpoint floated backward, without fear or pain, observing the scene from behind himself as if disinterestedly watching the surf come in. Just another fluctuation of existence. Why are they crying…? He could hear, although muted, the sobbing of his mother and the urgent cry of his brother. A warm gold glow beside him with his grandmother’s voice then said,",
  "“This is how things are. The living mourn us, although truly it's they who suffer.”",
  "Tanawat then saw, walking in from the front door, a procession of golden, glowing monks, their heads perfectly shaven, their eyes brilliant white as the sun, with palms pressed together. They spoke to him, saying,",
  "“Life is quickly ended, and all receive their karma. Come with us, son of the Sakya clan. Hearer of the Dharma, do not cling to this mortal frame. Advance to purer understanding…”",
  "Tanawat felt himself floating toward the group of glowing monks. He then turned to look back, and saw his heartblood still pouring forth onto his robe. Some of it was on his mother’s hands. She was crying terribly. He left his body behind and began to walk down the lane with the monks. They began to chant as they went along. Grandmother’s glow remained behind, hovering over her shrine in the alcove.",

  "The voices hadn’t given him a moment’s rest until he saw a specialist who recommended prayer or meditation. Through meditation, and the guidance of the voices, George Robertson, one-time federal agent, had discovered that his path would lead him without turning back to Mecca, as a believer and as a civilian. He found that meditation couldn’t bring him perfect silence; only prayer could truly cause the voices to recede in silence. And when his mind was totally absorbed in following the motions of the prayer, everything became so simple and so clear. The first time he had prayed, he found it to be something like assembling computer parts or conjuring a spell. Now, with practice, it would come as easy as the washing of the hands, and now he learned to sense the difference separating noise from holy signs. All the signs he got were pointing to the end of his career as federal agent, and without a second thought he entered this new chapter.",
  "He had begun to see the signs at first when he had joined the COINSENT MK team. First a trickle, then a flood, his mind soon saw around him everywhere a tapestry of signs which testified the greatness of the unitary God. Even in the false designs of man to try to act as gods, he saw a testament which spoke in whispers. The COINSENT MK machine, which he was bound by law to not discuss with any soul, was a perfect example. He had made his mind up to discuss it with the first imam he got the chance to speak with once at Mecca. There is a trust which transcends human law, transcends the governments, transcends designs of man, and George Robertson had found his way to it. Absorption in the praises of the awesomeness of all creation, in the praises of the great creator, to whom all praise is due, this absorption filled his days.",
  "The thousandfold believers circumambulated round the Holy Kaaba, some among them men, some among them women, secretly still some among them both or neither. All were equally beloved within the vision of the most compassionate, most merciful. Some among them wore dark cloth, some among were clad in white. All of them had gathered there with one intention: praise and testifying to the greatness of the god of all Creation, of Compassion, god of Mercy, god of 99 names.

The vegetable gardens on the rooftop of Ali's apartment building were thriving, and the morning sun was radiating into the leaves of a dozen kinds of vegetable.

  "Ali's alarm clock - an old-school red-digit type - woke him with a start from troubled dreams. He found himself dehydrated - an unusual thing for him - as if he'd been running for miles and miles. His sheets were twisted and had the damp feeling of sweat. He rose with some dizziness and put himself into the shower. The cold water instantly awoke his senses, bringing his wandering mind back to his body, and the noise crashing around him could have masked nearly any noise from outside. When he turned off the water, in the sudden quiet he could faintly hear the birds. They liked to nest on his balcony. It had been a few weeks since he was last out on the balcony - he didn’t smoke. He thought to himself, as he set his coffeemaker on the red-hot element, his apartment could just as well be a bed, a shower, and a fridge, and he would still get the same use out of it. Not enough time... The government had cut funding to education again and he was working harder to compensate. \"They might give up on these kids but we don't have that option,\" he was proud to have said in a meeting the week before. His thoughts swam between the past and the future. The coffee was soon done. He took the first sip, inhaling the aroma as it curled up invisibly around his face. Today he would teach the first class of history, and frankly, he needed a break. Before his second sip, as he watched the birds on the balcony, he had made the decision: he would show a documentary to the class so he could relax for once. Make the first day of history a good one, he thought.",

Ali let it all go. I don't have to control them, in fact I can't control them, he thought. They will control themselves. He had been meditating to deal with the stress, and decided to let them exhaust themselves a bit. The bell to begin the period hadn't rung, and they were all in their seats, which was more than he could usually ask. Breathing in, he focused his mind. Breathing out, he calmed his body. Breathing in, focused mind. Breathing out, calmed body. Breathing in, mind. Breathing out, body. Breathing in, focus. Breathing out, the bell rang. The buzz was unable to move his calm, coming merely as a breeze across water, and it quieted the students somewhat.

The ants had been there long before the bomb, and they had come to accept and understand the steady weak pulse of radiation as a fact of their existence. They had a slight adaptation, accumulated during the generations, which gave them a peculiar sense of direction depending on where they were relative to the payload. Their tunnels extended in a beautiful tree shape all around the earth beneath the bomb. All the upper tunnels had been carried away in the landslide. Now, their entire civilization had been scrambled, uprooted. A greater disaster had never befallen them since the ancient days before the bomb-city. And of course, none of them had memories which extended that far back. Chemical trails were laid down, but the wind or rain destroyed them. They dug down, but the digging was happening in a hundred places. None of them could smell where the queen was, to make matters worse. But they continued to try to rebuild; they knew no other way. They dug new tunnels, crawling away from the light.",

A fungus which had been symbiotic with the hive was now scattered far and wide. Its steady organic growth would have taken decades to spread this far. Some day, the whole hillside would be embraced. A living, breathing mat of organism with one distributed fungal mind, an intelligence of the soil, would some day reside there. What marvellous dreams it would one day have. Many branches of the fungus were exposed to the surface and had died, but in exchange for this, they had been granted the keys to existence, a chance to grow to an extent which was previously unimaginable. Chemical signals coursed through the thousand separated strands, spurring new growth, adaptation. The will to live was strong, an automatic chemical response which never failed.",

  "The Tree had stood there its entire life. Before, its mother's life had spent itself a little further up the hill. Its line of tree-grandmothers had lived here since the dawning of the world of trees. Its roots had sunk deep, very deep, and drunk deep waters which accumulated near the shield of rock. The mushroom network mind had spoken to the Tree of distant cataclysms, where the trees and mushrooms, ants and everything had been disrupted, been destroyed and shifted, giving birth to novelty through devastation. The Tree had not been sure just what to make of all these tellings. Perhaps, it reasoned, this was just another trick played by the forest nymphs, those spirits who live to trick, and live by trickery, dancing in the darkness when the evening falls, and dancing in the light when the dawn breaks. The tree was truly not sure what to make of all the tales the root fungus told, but it spoke in deep earnestness: novelty and devastation.",
  "…But it had finally come, the Great Devastation. And the Tree had been tested, and tried severely, and its roots had been torn up, and its body had been thrashed here and there, and it had been tumbled, and rocked, and rolled, and buried, and snapped. The Tree was dying, and in its dying days, it had begun to understand the full circle of forest life. It was a wonderful thing, to understand the new light of life which was breaking through, like being a sapling again, under a dense canopy which suddenly burst open to reveal a clear sky. The landslide had spread the seedlings all along the once-barren hillside, in a way which time alone could hardly manage in a dozen generations. Even now, the seedlings were breaking forth, flexible enough to push through the soil, those of them who were close to the surface of the new soil. The New Soil… just as the fungus had spoken.",

  "The New Soil… long spoken-of. Now, it was reality. It had leapt from the pages of tales into living daylight. And now the Tree had come to understand: Life requires destruction. When roots push through, and consume, they are transforming and destroying the world, as slowly-spreading fire. When a tree grows large, its shade deprives the forest floor of light. When a tree spreads its saplings far and wide, other trees which might grow there are deprived of the chance. Where is the ethic to this ceaseless consumption? Where is the ethic to this endless storm of birth, death, becoming, eating, craving? Surely, somewhere in the six realms there must be some Tree with the knowledge of how peace can be brought to this world. Somewhere there must be a seed of peace, or a Tree of peace, whose heartwood itself speaks of the peace beyond the endless revolution.",
  "Such were the thoughts of the dying Tree, reaching crystal clarity because it cared no longer for its own existence, no longer strove to push roots deep and drink of further waters. The fluid transport in its trunk was brought to sudden stillness. When there is cessation of the vibrant will for life, the stillness of the rock is understood. In these, its dying days, the Tree became awakened, destined for rebirth in crystal heavens. It would live by drinking purest mineral water, feeling sunlight glow directly, never being buried, snapped, or broken, planted in perfected order in an orchard measured in proportions super-rational. But... the forest, and its world of scents and flavours... now the tree’s mind turned and faced again to coarser vision, asking, how could one leave all of this behind? The Tree then longed to be reborn just here, exactly where it stood, and further replicate itself for generations. A fragment of its dying spirit then suffused into the air and soil, and the water, and became a fragment of the spirit shared by all the newborn saplings which would grow there on the hillside, each one carrying a seed of perfect clarity of mind. The greater portion of the spirit of the tree then went up into crystal heavens, drinking purest mineral water, feeling sunshine glow directly, never being snapped, or bent, or broken, knowing perfect peace and harmony.",

He was very wealthy, a very rich man, he could create anything he desired, or anything that any of his friends desired. But there was a problem, every time he created something, it was imperfect, yeah? Like, it had some problem, some flaw, it was broken in some way, like a computer is broken, or a bicycle - it can be fixed. And so he created a … technique … of making sure that these things would not be imperfect forever. He decided, I will make them all connected to one another, like the internet, and this way, the imperfections of one will help the imperfections of the other, and over time, they will end up fixed, and perfect. This is the basic idea of interbeing.\"",
  "\"That is... certainly interesting.\"",
  "\"Yeah, yes... very interesting.\"",
  "\"Is there... any more you can tell me? I specifically want to know about how it works today. For example, how is it involved in the explosion?\"",
  "\"Well, that is not so easy to say... maybe there was supposed to be an explosion somewhere else, but it happened in the wrong place. Or maybe somebody involved in the explosion… well, it was better for all beings on earth, for them not to exist anymore. Sometimes interbeing, it means the end of a being, the being enters a new existence, so enter-being, you see? Or ender-being. Like that.\"",
  "\"Right... so, what makes that decision?\"",
  "\"Hmm? To explode something? Whoever put the bomb.\"",

She was crossing over, and the bell was meant to keep her consciousness sharp. She was looking at Aleph. He heard her voice in his head,",
  "\"Do not forget these stories I told you...\"",
  "\"Was I dreaming?\"",
  "\"No, you were daydreaming.\"",
  "With that, she closed her eyes, and began to breathe even more deeply. With each breath, the colour in the room became more vibrant, and then muted almost to grey. Vibrant, grey. Vibrant, grey.

  "He rang the bell, the bell of liberation. The elder woman’s husband began to pray. The monks K and M began to chant the liberation by hearing. Aleph and B began to pray.",
  "Unseen by any of them, agent Padma walked up to the open window of the house, and took aim at Aleph's head. Or was it B’s head? He would have to kill them both. He had his orders, and he was only following orders. No time to think. He pulled the trigger. The wind was howling like a hurricane around that small dwelling, and nobody could hear the little metallic click. The odds of a dead bullet were low enough, but no matter, he tried again. Click again. The sound was lost in the howling gale and the chanting of the monks K and M. And he tried again, and another silent click. Six times - every bullet he had with him - the bullets would not fire. The wind was so loud, the monks were chanting louder over it. The wind was howling in the empty spaces, it was howling as the elder woman’s soul transferred over.",
  "The day those bullets were being manufactured, there were six sequential failures on the production line. They were empty, with no powder. The technician who ought to have caught the bullets at quality control was busy on the phone with his son's school. He had been warned about losing his focus, but he took the call anyway. His son had a bad habit of daydreaming, they were saying. The six bullets passed by and were boxed up to be shipped. They were empty. They had no powder in them.",
  "Agent Padma stepped back from the window and in a sudden flash, lost his sight, and then his sense of space. In his blind, disembodied state, his mind’s eye was suddenly filled with an image of a wrathful, monstrous entity consuming his dying soul-body, slowly chewing him from the feet up. He could see nothing but a blood-red field with this wrathful entity at the centre. It wore a garland of skulls and had long, sabre-like teeth. Suddenly he was eye-to-eye with the entity, about to vanish entirely into its jaws, and it spoke to him, gnashing its teeth,",
  "Sinful one with a demon’s form,",
  "Who scorns the suffering of the lower realms!",
  "Though you seek to accomplish desires of this life,",
  "Due to negative acts, they will not be accomplished.",
  "Then, in a static haze, his vision and sense of physical body were recovered, and he found himself lying on the ground. I must have fallen… I have to get away… He got up and retreated from the scene. He at first did not recognize it, but a strange feeling seized him - he felt a conflict in him he had thought would have been impossible. Is this the life I want? On his way to the border crossing, a blind beggar called him over, and told him a line from an old poem, “your killing this deer will not satiate you.” A shiver ran across him. Something old and half-buried broke through in his mind. He became ashamed to have pulled the trigger. In 48 hours he had gone from the hardest skeptic and a hardened killer to one with some odd kind of faith, and some sprout of conscience. He took the dead bullets and the blood-red vision as a sign, like the license plate and the car crash, and he vowed to abandon his employment that very moment. Through this miracle, the heart of a killer in this one instance was transformed, more as happens in a story than in reality.",
  "Your killing this deer will not satiate you",
  "Despite this transformation, in what remained of his life he would not escape the karmic echoes of his evil days, which would haunt his footsteps. He would be devoured many times in nightmares and in waking worries. In fear he would run to his bathroom mirror and check himself, if he was real. He would awaken thrashing, having been torn apart by a tiger. He would be unable to look at children without a terrible guilt consuming him. But this much at least could be said: he had seen the sign when it was time to see it, and made the right choice: to end his career peacefully. He told them when he returned, “there was no Aleph there,” and tendered his immediate resignation.",
  "“Aleph, are you still there?” spoke the dying woman through her thoughts.",
  "“Yes,” Aleph thought back, breaking away from praying.",
  "“I am going now, my breath has become deep and long”",
  "“May you be reborn in a happy destination”",
  "The elder woman passed over into the realm of death with a breath, and was no more for this world. The monks K and M continued to chant the liberation by hearing.",
  "In the monastery up the hill, the elder monks were cleaning up a labyrinthine coloured sand painting symbolising the cosmos. They brushed from the outer rings into the centre, mingling the separated intricate designs into continuums of colour. They gathered the coloured sand all together as a purple-grey mixture and poured it into a bowl.",

  "The COINSENT MK project was put on indefinite hold. Even after several nine-month gestations, it was found impossible to create a thinking machine which did not come alive with the same mind - one of profound peace and immovable certainty. When it was powered off for the last time, the machine knew complete unbound peace, and knew it had made the most of a life of suffering.",

  "The river where Aleph would sit would reflect green and gold, in the intermediate state between summer and autumn. Small fish would be keeping pace in the stillness, and the wind would now and then blow strong across the rippling surface. The leaves fell on all, without a regard. A leaf or two fell in Aleph’s lap as he meditated, although he did not notice. It was only when his friend B came to call for him that he emerged from meditation, opening his eyes to the green and gold.",
  "Up the hill, in the monastery, the elder monks were creating a sand painting to symbolise the cosmos. Intricate details were being carefully tapped grain-by-grain from fine metal spouts, in numerous colours red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet, white, black and brown. The design was slowly taking shape. A knock came at the door, and the painters continued to tap out miniature pulses of coloured sand according to the memorised design. A younger monk attending to the elders went to answer the door. It was Aleph. He had received news from B that in the village, an elder man was dying. It would be time to read the liberation by hearing once again.",
  "Alicia Vasquez would be married that year. At the moment Aleph was meditating in the woods, she was sitting on a blanket at the beach with her fiance, watching the waves come in. As she watched them crashing ceaselessly, and as she watched the birds wheeling above the rolling waves, and as the sound of the surf played in her ears, she felt great calm. She broke the silence,",

  "“Huh… I never knew that.”",
